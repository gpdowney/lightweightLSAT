# lightweight-lsat v0.6

*The lightweight LSAT* is a simple, proven, and completely free guide to the LSAT.

## About the website

The site is built with MkDocs using the Material theme to take advantage of built-in features like search, comments, and navigation.

Outside of comments (via github discussions) and donations (via stripe) the site collects no user data.

Here on GitHub you'll find the actual content of the site in the markdown files in the "docs" folder.
