# Alternatives to *the lightweight LSAT*

*The lightweight LSAT* isn't for everyone and it doesn't cover everything. Here are some resources you can use to supplement or replace *the lightweight LSAT*:

- Many of my prior students also enjoyed [the *LSAT Trainer* by Mike Kim (external link)][trainer].
- For more comprehensive dive into to the Reasoning or Games sections, I recommend looking for a used copy of Manhattan Prep or PowerScore strategy guides. (I don't recommend their advice about the Reading section.)
- For free question explanations, check out [Manhattan Prep's forums (external link)][mprep] or [LSAT Hacks (external link)][hacks].
- If you want an interactive online platform with videos and the option to add on classes and tutoring, I trust the folks at [LSAT Lab (external link)][lab].

!!! tip "Start with free and cheap resources."

    When you hit a wall in how much you can learn on your own, then consider a class.

    If you need more after your class finishes, then consider a 1-on-1 tutor.
