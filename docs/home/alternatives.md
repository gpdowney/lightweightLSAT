# Alternatives to *the lightweight LSAT*

*The lightweight LSAT* isn't for everyone and it doesn't cover everything. Here are some resources you can use to supplement or replace *the lightweight LSAT*:

- Many of my prior students also enjoyed [the *LSAT Trainer* by Mike Kim][trainer]{:target="_blank"}.
- For more comprehensive dive into to the Reasoning or Games sections, I recommend looking for a used copy of Manhattan Prep or PowerScore strategy guides. (I don't recommend their advice about the Reading section.)
- For free question explanations, check out [Manhattan Prep's forums][mprep]{:target="_blank"} or [LSAT Hacks][hacks]{:target="_blank"}.
- If you want an interactive online platform with videos and the option to add on classes and tutoring, I trust the folks at [LSAT Lab][lab]{:target="_blank"}.

!!! tip "Start with free and cheap resources."

    When you hit a wall in how much you can learn on your own, then consider a class.

    If you need more after your class finishes, then consider a 1-on-1 tutor.
