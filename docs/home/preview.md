# Preview of the *the lightweight LSAT*

If you want to preview *the lightweight LSAT* system, here a few techniques to try out that might help you get an extra point on your next test.

## Do the IF questions before the WHICH questions in the Games section

(Or actually, do the easy LIST question first, then the IFs.)

*Why it works:* the IFs (and easy LISTs) will give you valid hypos that you can use to prove or disprove answers on the WHICHes.

## Eliminate strong answers in the Reading section

*Why it works:* passages tend to be nuanced, so strong answers tend to be unprovable.

## Anchor yourself in a basic understanding of the argument before you read the answers in the Reasoning section

*Why it works:* You don't always need to spot the problem with the argument.
You must always understand what the argument said.

## Stop and breathe to save time

When you feel rushed or stressed out, stop for a second to regain control.

*Why it works:* Everyone struggles to maintain focus.
Top scorers are just better at noticing when they lose focus and then bringing their focus back to what they need to do.
