# support this project

The Lightweight LSAT is completely and permanently free.

There's no catch, no upsell, no paywalls, no ads, no data collection. 

The content is open source, hosted on [GitHub](https://github.com/gpdowney/lightweightLSAT) and licensed under [Creative Commons BY-SA 4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/). And, I can't take your money for tutoring because I'm retired from LSAT teaching.

But if you wish to support this project, you can donate a few dollars.

## Pay what you can

Buy me a [coffee :coffee: ($5)][coffee] or a [pizza :pizza: ($25)][pizza] or several coffees and pizzas to show your love for the site!

## You're a patron, not a customer

Patrons support projects that benefit their community.

Your donation will help to keep this guide free for everyone, forever. Or at least until the LSAT hopefully, finally becomes irrelevant.
