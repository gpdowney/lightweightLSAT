# Evaluating Answer Choices Is Not Unlike Swiping On A Dating App

When you see a deal-breaker (all group photos, no group photos, a fish photo, a political endorsement, a messy bathroom selfie, whatever it is for you) swipe left without hesitation.

If you need to swipe left 5 times then swipe left 5 times. Don't lower your standards on the apps! You deserve better.

But on the LSAT, there's only 5 eligible answers. So once you swipe left 5 times, you do actually need to go back and lower your standards a smidge.

And, like dating, having some detailed list of requirements will get in your way. Sure, know what you don't like. But maybe don't go in looking for something so specific. Be open to the right ideas in new words.
