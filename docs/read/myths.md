# 4 Myths about the Reading Section

Myth | **Reality**
-- | --
You can't improve at Reading | *You can improve if you read differently*
You should speed read | *You should move at your own pace*
You need to memorize *what* the text said | *You need to understand **why** the author wrote it*
You must take notes | *You must pause and re-read*

## Myth 1: you can't improve at reading

Someone on the internet may have told you that Reading isn't improvable. Maybe that person couldn't improve their own score or they couldn't help you improve. This only proves only that that person lacks insight into what the Reading section is testing.

The Reading section of the LSAT requires a specific kind of reading and a specific approach to the questions.

## Reality 1: improve by reading for the nuanced conflict

There's nearly always some conflict.
Rarely are passages neutral.

The authors, often academics, have written these texts for some reason.
They usually believe they have a special insight into the issue, a slightly different way of looking at things.

To add to the subtlety, the author may speak through another person.
They use the work of a "poet and historian" or "critic and artist" or another doubly-honored person to lend their arguments credibility.

Out of politeness, they will often be indirect in their attacks on the status quo or the other side.
They probably wont name names.
They may even spend a large portion of the text arguing the other side's case just to show how misguided it is.

You can learn to see through these obscurities to identify the author's core point.
Thankfully, seeing through bad writing is a useful skill for law school and life in general.

## Myth 2: speed-read

The LSAT is a terrible place to start speed-reading.

If you want to learn how to speed-read, practice speed-reading on something else, something easier than the LSAT.

Skimming is also a bad idea on the LSAT. You cannot skim on Reading because every word matters. (Although not every word matters equally.)

## Reality 2: read at an adaptive pace

Speed up when you can. Slow down when you need to.

When to speed up | When to slow down
-- | --
Middle | Beginning
Details | Opinion
Lists |  Strong words
Parentheticals | Pivot words
When you get it | When you don't get it
In the questions | In the text

## Myth 3: memorize *what* the text said

You want to memorize and speed-read at the same time??
Woah, no wonder you're having a hard time.

Memorizing a bunch of boring, random facts is impossible, or at least very time consuming.

## Reality 3: find the *why* of the text

Rather than trying to memorize a bunch of discrete *whats*, look for the *why* behind the text.

The "why" connects the "whats."
The connections you make trying to understand the purpose will help you remember all the details you need.

Reading questions are more likely to ask about the why of the text, anyways.
Only a few of the whats will be tested, and when that happens you can go back to the text.

## Myth 4: Take Notes

Notes have three major disadvantages:

1. Note-taking consumes precious time.
1. Underlining/highlighting replaces understanding. You note that something was important, instead of thinking about **why** it's important.
1. Taking notes, especially while reading, distracts you with detail. You get caught up in the whats.

Notes may be useful but largely because they force you stop to reflect.

## Reality 4: Take Breaks

Pausing and re-reading are more valuable than notes.

Pauses give your brain a chance to process.
Re-reading allows you to fix misunderstandings before they compound.

Stop to look for context clues when you don't understand what a word means.
Take a breath and start fresh when you realize you *looked* at every word in the last paragraph but didn't actually *read* it.
Pause to reflect when the text surprises you, when it takes a turn you weren't expecting.

!!! note "On focus"

    Some students believe "focus" means "uninterrupted staring."
    They believe that focus is a matter of willpower and a measure of their worth as a human being.
    These are incorrect and unhelpful beliefs because they prevent students from re-reading and pausing when they need to.

    I often lose focus when I'm reading.
    But I'm good at noticing when I'm distracted, so I reset more quickly and more often.
