# 4 Myths About The Reading Section

Myth | **Reality**
You can't improve at Reading | **You can improve if you read differently**
You should speed read | **You should move at your own pace**
You need to memorize *what* the text said | **You need to understand *why* the author wrote it**
You must take notes | **You must pause and re-read**

## Myth 1: You Can't Improve At Reading

Maybe you've heard from someone that Reading isn't improvable. Maybe that person couldn't improve their own score or they couldn't help you improve. This only proves only that that person doesn't understand what the Reading section is testing.

The Reading section of the LSAT requires a specific kind of reading and a specific approach to the questions.

- It's not the same as reading journalism or fiction.
- It's not the same as reading for most college courses.
- It's not even the same as reading for other standardized tests.

## Reality 1: You Can Improve If You Read Differently, If You Read For The Nuanced Conflict

Understanding conflict is, thankfully, very relevant for law school.

## Myth 2: You Should Read Faster

The LSAT is a terrible place to start speed-reading.

If you want to learn how to speed-read, practice speed-reading on something else, something easier than the LSAT.

And don't skim either. You cannot skim on Reading because every word matters. (Although not every word matters equally.)

## Reality 2: You Should Move At An Adaptive Pace

Speed up when you can. Slow down when you need to.

Speed up | Slow Down
-- | --
Middle | Beginning
Details | Opinion
Lists |  Strong words
Parentheticals | Pivot words
When you get it | When you don't get it
In the questions | In the text

And more on [crushing the questions][crush]

## Myth 3: You Need To Memorize *What* The Text Said

You want to memorize and speed-read at the same time?? Woah, no wonder you're having a hard time.

Memorizing a bunch of boring, random facts is impossible, or at least very time consuming.

## Reality 3: You Need To Find The *Why* Of The Text

Rather than trying to memorize a bunch of discrete *whats*, look for the *why* behind the text. 

The why connects the whats together. The connections you make trying to understand the why will help you remember all the whats you need.

And Reading questions are more likely to ask about the why of the text, anyways.

Only a few of the whats will be tested, and when that happens you can go back to the text.

## Myth 4: You Must Take Notes

Notes have three major disadvantages:

1. Note-taking consumes precious time.
1. Underlining/highlighting replaces understanding. You note that something was important, instead of thinking about **why** it's important.
1. Taking notes, especially while reading, distracts you with detail. You get caught up in the whats.

## Reality 4: You Must Pause And Re-Read

It's difficult, perhaps impossible, for our human brains to multitask. We cannot at the same time, both read words and process those words. 

This is one major cause of **loss of focus**. Your poor brain is trying to deal with the last weird sentence you read, while your eyes are trying look at the next one. When that happens, you fail to understand either sentence. And when that keeps happening, because you keep pushing onward, you become even more confused and bored.

Notes may be useful, accidentally, because they force you stop to think and reflect. 

Try, instead, whenever you would take a note, pause to synthesize or re-read instead.

If, after trying no-notes, you decide you absolutely must take notes, then your notes should:

- Happen after you understand; and
- Be minimalist (just a few words).
