# Read For The Nuanced Conflict

## Every Text Has A Conflict

If you don't think there's a conflict, look again.

## The Conflict Will Not Be A Simple Binary

A simple binary is A vs B.

- Dogs are better than cats.
- The proletariat must resist the oppression of the capitalists.

The LSAT favors nuance.

- You cannot understand the evolution of anti-trust law without understanding neoliberalism.
- Torts and Contracts are functionally the same area of law.
- Although judges claim to be neutral, ideology predicts the outcome of cases more reliably than precedent.

To understand the conflict, you should understand both 

1. the *content* and
2. the *degree* of the disagreement.

Know what the author believes, know what they're against, and know how strongly they're against it.

## Read For The *Why*

Most LSAT texts come from academia and high-end journalism. Academics and high-end journalists write because they believe they have some new and brilliant insight. 

There's always a reason they wrote this text. 

As you read, pause to ask yourself: "**Why** did they write this?"

Every word was included for a reason.

Use your understanding of the author's purpose to contextualize the details. In other words, use the *why* to understand the *whats*.
