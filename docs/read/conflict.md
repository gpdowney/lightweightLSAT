# Read For The Nuanced Conflict

## Every text has a conflict

If you don't think there's a conflict, look again.

## The conflict will not be a simple binary

!!! example "Simple Binaries"

    - A vs. B
    - Dogs are better than cats.
    - The proletariat must resist the oppression of the capitalists.

The LSAT favors nuance.

!!! example "Nuanced conflicts"

    - You cannot understand the evolution of anti-trust law without understanding neoliberalism.
    - Torts and Contracts are functionally the same area of law.
    - Although judges claim to be neutral, ideology predicts the outcome of cases more reliably than precedent.

To understand the conflict, you should understand both the...

1. *content* and
2. *degree* of the disagreement.

Know what the author believes, know what they're against, and know how strongly they're against it.

## Read for the *why*

Most LSAT texts come from academia and high-end journalism. Academics and high-end journalists write because they believe they have some new and brilliant insight.

There's always a reason they wrote this text.
As you read, pause to ask yourself: "**Why** did they write this?"

Every word was included for a reason.
Use your understanding of the author's purpose to contextualize the details.
Use the *why* to understand the *whats*.
