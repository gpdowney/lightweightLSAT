# Benchmarks

This page outlines a set of timing benchmarks you could use on test day. Some alternatives are suggested based on your score goals or the difficulty of the question.

As with everything in *the Lightweight LSAT*, adapt this based on your current needs and capacity.

And remember, "easier" and "hardier" is always subjective--what matters is what you think.

## Logic Games

Aiming for a perfect score:
- Easier two games done in ~12:00 total.
- Harder two games done ~11:00 each.

Struggling with time:
- Pick 1 game to skip.
- Spend ~11:00 each to do the other 3 excellently.

### Easier Games

Each question: 0:30

### Harder Games

Set-up: 2:30-4:00

Each question: 1:00

## Reading Comprehension

Read: 3:00 +/- 0:30

Each question: 0:45 +/- 0:15

## Logical Reasoning

Above 163: 1:00/question. Less on easy questions. Much more on hard questions.

157-163: 1:20/question.

Below 157: 1:40/question. Invest in questions that make sense. Move on from questions that don't.
