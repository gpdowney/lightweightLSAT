# How to Slow Down

The pressure of the timer causes many students to *rush* through the LSAT. This rushing causes avoidable mistakes and ultimately wastes time.

> Slow is smooth, and smooth is fast.

To be clear, this doesn't mean you should go *slow* on test day. Instead, it means, in certain specific situations, go slightly slower in order to stay in control.

## Resets

The best tool for staying in control is taking deliberate **resets**.

What follows here are more ideas about when and why you should slow down.

## Invest in Understanding

In both the Reading and Reasoning sections, slowing down to understand the text/argument can ultimately save you time. When you invest time in understanding, you can move more decisively through the answers.

In the Reading section, this is why speed-reading the text doesn't help with timing. If you don't actually understand the text, you'll end up wasting far more time in the answers.

In the Reasoning section, this is why pausing to predict is so important. Predictions grounds you in your understanding before the answers have a chance to turn you around.

As you practice, learn to recognize what's a good enough understanding and what's not. 

One useful clue is: if you confidently eliminated all 4 wrong answers, then your understanding was good enough.

## Trust Your Confusion

When you ignore your confusion in order to rush ahead, you risk compounding that confusion and wasting even more time.

    Example: When a game's rule doesn't make sense, you may have misread it. 
    
    If you play that game with that wrong rule, you're likely to get many questions wrong.

Confusion is not only a sign that you did something wrong (although it often is), confusion can also reveal the LSAT's secrets and traps. For example:

- When an argument seems hard to follow, that might be because you've identified the gap in the reasoning. 
- When you find an answer choice to be confusing, there's a good chance it's confused (aka wrong).

## Adapt to Your Personal "Silly" Mistakes

Rushing can lead to "silly" mistakes like misreading the question or clicking on the wrong answer choice.

The solution to these "silly" mistakes is not, however, to slow down uniformly. Rather, the solution is to slow down very slightly at strategic moments.

For example, in the Games section, I tend to misread the questions. So I read the question again after I've selected an answer. I do this only in the Games section, because I don't tend to make the same mistake in Reading or Reasoning. Maybe for you this would be a waste of time. For me, it's essential. 

**Keep track of the "silly" mistakes that *you* make so you can build in specific redundancies to correct them.**
