# General Timing Strategy

Timing is the biggest challenge of the LSAT.

Many students could get a top score if there wasn't a time limit.
And then it wouldn't be a top score anymore.

To finish the test on time, you need to be able to...

1. [Speed up][speed], and
2. [Slow down][slow].

Mastering both speeding up and slowing down allows you to remain in the driver's seat as you take the test.
If you don't drive, the LSAT will, and the LSAT is a terrible driver.

## Difficulty is subjective

If you thought something on the LSAT was hard, then it was hard.

If you thought it was easy, then it was easy.

## Suggested Timing Benchmarks

In general, gain time on easier questions, so that you can take your time on harder questions.

!!! warning

    These benchmarks are what I would use on test day to achieve a top score.
    *Adapt them to your needs.*

    If you aren't close to your test day score goals, modify these targets by giving yourself more time or doing fewer questions.
    If you're doing [skill] practice, give yourself much more time to do even fewer questions.
