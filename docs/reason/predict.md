# Anchor, Flexible, and Specific Predictions

You must always prepare for the Answers.

The Answers have been carefully engineered in a high-tech lab to confuse you!

If you are confused about the Argument, then you will only get more confused by the Answers. Rushing to the Answers is worse than a waste of time.

Before you look at any Answer, know what you want the correct Answer to do.

To be clear: you don't need a perfect Understanding. Your Prediction doesn't need to take more than 2 seconds. You just need to stop and collect yourself before you venture into the dangerous territory of the Answers.

## A Useful Drill:

1. Write down your Prediction before you look at the Answers.
1. Then Answer.
1. Before you check your Answer, ask yourself: "Was my Prediction useful?"
1. After you check, compare your Prediction to the correct Answer. Ask yourself: "Did I Predict enough or too much" (The question's style tells you what kind of Prediction was appropriate and, thus, what you could have expected yourself to see in advance of the Answers.)

## ANCHOR in Understanding

An Anchor is barely a Prediction. You should always Anchor in your Understanding. Know what you know.

Anchors require less energy, but they aren't lazy. Anchors are not an excuse to rush into the Answers. You still need to pause and ground yourself in what you know.

Often, an Anchor is all you need. As with [most DESCRIBE questions][describe]. (This is what makes them easier.)

Often, Anchoring is all you can do. You will not always see the Problem on a [HELP][help]/[HURT][hurt] question], or the Connection on a [MOST SUPPORTED question][supported].

Anchors rarely lead you to the Right Answer; they're better at helping you cross out [Irrelevant][irrelevant] Answers.

## Stay FLEXIBLE on ORGANIC Questions {#flexible}

On ORGANIC questions a Flexible Prediction will serve you better than a Specific one.

### On ARGUE/ORGANIC questions, your Flexible Prediction is the Argument's PROBLEM

Avoid Predicting one specific Solution. It's [better to Predict the Problem][problem] so that you can be Flexibly prepared for different or unexpected solutions.

Correct Answers on HELP, HURT, and DEPENDS questions can include new ideas. Correct Answers often introduce (for HURT questions) or rule out (for HELP + DEPENDS questions) damaging alternatives. With a Flexible Prediction, you're better prepared for these unexpectable Answers.

### On MOST SUPPORTED questions, your Flexible Prediction is the Facts that are likely to CONNECT

Caution: Unlike ARGUE Family questions, the correct Answer on an INFER question will not introduce new ideas.

## Get SPECIFIC on MECHANICAL questions {#specific}

On MECHANICAL questions, a Specific Prediction allows you to move ruthlessly through the Answers.

A Specific Prediction is a good investment on MECHANICAL questions because, unlike ORGANIC questions, you can reliably guess what the Correct Answer will say.

And the Wrong Answers can be especially tricky on MECHANICAL questions. You're very likely to get turned around in them without a Specific Prediction.

Often, Conditional Diagramming can help with Specific Predictions. What you Diagram will depend on the question.

- For JUSTIFY questions (and some DEPENDS questions), Diagram to reveal the missing link (the Gap).
- For PARALLEL questions, Diagram the Argument's structure to see if each Answer is the same.
- For MUST BE TRUE questions, Diagram to combine the Facts.
- For PRINCIPLE questions, Diagram the given rules to see if each Answer follows them.
