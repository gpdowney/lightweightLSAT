# the Argue Family

This page describes...

1. the [general patterns of all Argue family questions](#general-patterns-of-the-argue-family); and then 
2. how to recognize and approach the four common types, including
    - [Hurt](#hurt),
    - [Help](#help),
    - [Justify](#justify), and
    - [Depends](#depends) questions;
3. plus [a bonus section on how to **negate** answer choices](#negate) for Depends questions.

## General Patterns of the Argue Family

In the Argue family, your job is to either **hurt** or **help** the argument. Every argument in this family has some problem you can either address or exploit. 

These problems are typically either:

- Flaws,
- Gaps, or
- What ifs

[Learn how to spot flaws, gaps, and what ifs.][flaws]

There are 2 common types of *wrong* answers in the Argue family:

Backwards answers | helps the argument when you were supposed to hurt it <br>(or vice versa)
Irrelevant answers | doesn't address the argument's problem

On Mechanical-Argue questions, the correct answer will not include any new ideas. But on Organic-Argue questions, correct answers often introduce or rule out alternatives.

For example, if an argument claimed:

    We need to help residents move around the city as quickly as possible. So the government should fund highways instead of public transportation.

It would be relevant to know:

    More than 25% of residents can't afford a car.

In contrast, even though it uses similar words, it would not matter if:

    Residents believe public transportation is smelly.

## Bonus: How to Negate Depends Answers {#negate}

You should only negate answers on depends questions.

When you negate the correct answer, the argument will fall apart.

> If a wall is load-bearing, then the house depends on it. And there's a easy way to tell if a wall is load-bearing: knock it down.
> 
> [If the roof falls on you, then it was load-bearing][1].

When you negate the correct answer, you should feel a "Woah! That's bad for the argument"

When you negate the wrong answer you should feel: "Huh." The argument does not depend on the wrong answers, so negating them won't do anything.

{% capture summary %}
Caution: "Negation" does not mean "opposite."
{% endcapture %}
{% capture details %}
The negation of a statement is defined as the minimum required to disprove that statement.

Example:

    You never say anything nice.

Opposite:

    You only say nice things.

Negation:

    You said a nice thing once.

Some common negations:

Idea | Negation
-- | --
Is | Isn't
I am | I am not
I am always | I am sometimes not
I am never | I am sometimes
If A, then B | If A, maybe not B
All | Some not
None | Some
Some | None
Most | Most not
