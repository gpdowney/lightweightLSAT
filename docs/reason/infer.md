# the Infer Family

Infer questions only give you facts. In other words, on Infer questions, the "argument" isn't really an argument, because it's missing a conclusion.

On Infer questions, it's (usually) your job to *combine* the facts and choose the answer that is an allowable conclusion.

For the Argue family, the correct answers is an **assumption**. An assumption is a fact that's missing from the argument.

For the Infer family, correct answers are **inferences**. An inference is a missing conclusion that follows from the facts.

## There are 5 question types in the Infer Family:

1. [Most Supported](#most-supported)
1. [(Dis)Agree](#disagree)
1. [Must be True](#must-be-true)
1. [Must be False](#must-be-false)
1. [Rule](#rule)

Organic-Infer questions (Most Supported and (Dis)agree), can be hard to predict. Your flexible prediction will often be simply: know what you know and what you don't know. Also, they both favor **modest** answers.

Mechanical-Infer questions (Must be True, Must be False, and Rule) often feature conditional logic and benefit from drawing a diagram.

*Bonus: You can apply the lessons you learn for Most Supported questions in the Reasoning section to Medium questions in the Reading section (and vice versa).*

*Caution: Do not confuse the Reasoning process for Must be questions, with the Games process. You cannot use the lessons you learn here on Games (or vice versa).*
