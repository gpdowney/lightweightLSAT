# Move On or Revise

When you make 4 eliminations or 1 selection, you can skip this step.

This step is for when you make 5 or 3 (or fewer) eliminations.

## Option 1: Move On.

Moving On is usually the best option.

Making 5 or 3 eliminations reveals that this is a [hard question][1]. Investing time here could come at the expense of easier points later.

It might be out of your reach entirely. Or maybe it will be more obvious when you come back later. In either case, you should Move On for now.

## Option 2: Revise.

If have the time, or think it will be a quick fix, you can stick with a hard question. If you stay, however, you must change your approach. Whatever you did the first time didn't work.

Generally, one of two things has happened: you misread an Answer, or you inadequately Predicted.

So you can Revise your assessment of either (1) the Argument or (2) the Answers.

Most Test-Takers will agonize over the Answers. Beat [the Curve][3] by acting differently.

### Option 2A: Revise Your Prediction

Try to re-read the Argument with Fresh Eyes.

- Forget how you Understood it last time (because that didn't help.)
- Don't skim (this is a difficult question), instead read more carefully.

Often, re-Anchoring yourself in the Conclusion will be enough. (Then eliminate Irrelevant Answers.)

### Option 2B: Revise Your Eliminations

When you make 5 Eliminations: Lower your standards.

Make your Prediction more flexible, and/or be less picky about the answers.

When you make 3 (or fewer) Eliminations: Remain skeptical and increase your ruthlessness.

Apply the same level of Skepticism to all the answers. Don't be overly harsh on a decent answer and too easy on the bad ones.

## Flag Hard Questions

During the Test: these are the questions to revisit if you have extra time.

During Practice: Flag so you don't get stuck, especially if you're doing RACE practice. And Flag to let yourself know what you want to review.

Make sure to review all Flagged questions. Even if you got it right there's something you need to learn from it.

## [Reset] after Flagging

If you decide to Move On, Reset so you don't carry this mistake into the next question.

If you decide to Revise, Reset to give yourself fresh eyes and let go of whatever confused you the first time.

## Are you often down to 2 answers?

That doesn't mean you had an OK Understanding. It shows you had an incomplete Understanding and unhelpful Prediction. 

Or it shows that you didn't trust yourself.

It's better to make 5 eliminations than 3. At least then you're practicing trusting yourself. When you make 5 eliminations, at least you know something: you know that you don't know.
