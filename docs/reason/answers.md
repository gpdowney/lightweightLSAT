# Eliminate, Defer, Select

Read exactly what the Answer says. Don't add or subtract anything. Understand what it means.

Read all the Answers. But you don't have to read all of every Answer. As soon as they're wrong, they're [gone][1].

When you find an Answer you like, you can be extra [skeptical][2] of the rest. (Maybe you could be that skeptical always?)

When you get turned around by the Answers (this will happen), take a second to [Reset][3]. Remind yourself of your Job, Understanding, and/or Prediction.

Generally, on Reasoning, you should Eliminate, Defer, and then Select.

## Eliminate answers you know are wrong.

In Puzzle-practice explain what makes the bad Answers wrong. Avoid giving vague reasons like “it feels out of scope.” Find a specific word or phrase that poisons the Answer. Articulating reasons will help improve your intuitions and speed.

On Test day or during Race-practice, you will not always take the time articulate a clear reason.

## Defer on Weirdos.

You Defer in order to not get stuck.

“Huh” and “Maybe” are both great reasons to Defer on an Answer.

A confusing Answer might be confused. It's not worth figuring out.

Or maybe you don't get it. In which case, come back later, if you need to.

A Defer can be positive or negative. Notice how you feel about it. Trust and verify those feelings when you revisit it later.

## Select Answers you like.

Not merely "like" but "like like." You're marrying this Answer. Choosing it will bias you against the others. This will help you speed through them. (That's a good thing.) But you might speed past the actually correct one.

If you don't love it, notice that you like it and Defer. When there's nothing better you can choose it and move on.

## Exercise Idea: Rank the Answers

Give each Answer a rank from 1-6.
1. Love it
2. Like it
3. Unsure-Positive
4. Unsure-Negative
5. Dislike it
6. Hate it

Then pick the highest ranking Answer.

As you practice, try to figure out what it would take to have more 1/2s and 5/6s rather than 3/4s: 
- Do you just need to be more confident? 
- Do you need more useful (either more flexible or more specific) predictions? 
- Do you need to read the Answers for understanding?
