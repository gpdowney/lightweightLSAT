# Break Down the Structure of an Argument

This page describes how to break down the structure of arguments in the Reasoning section of the LSAT.

1. [The anatomy of an LSAT argument](#anatomy-of-an-argument), including:
    - facts,
    - conclusion,
    - context, and 
    - antithesis.
2. [How to distinguish the parts](#distinguishing-fact-from-conclusion), using:
    - [feel](#1-feel),

        - fact words,
        - conclusion words, and
        - pivot works.

## Anatomy of an Argument

Arguments have two essential parts: the **facts** and the **conclusion**. Every argument on the LSAT includes some statements that are facts and a single conclusion. The facts are intended to support the conclusion.

But arguments don't only consist of facts and a conclusion. Some statements in an argument may be **context** and/or an **antithesis**, which aren't strictly necessary to understand but can provide useful clues about the argument.

name | function | synonym(s)
-- | --
fact | basis of the argument | premise, support
conclusion | claim of the argument | opinion, holding, point
context | defines the argument's terms or scope | background
antithesis | what the argument is against | opposing point

{% capture summary %}
Note, there are also two types of implicit statements:
{% endcapture %}
{% capture details %}
1. A missing conclusion is an **inference**.
2. A missing fact is an **assumption**.

It can be nice to notice these implicit statements, but it's not essential to understanding the argument. In fact, generally you must understand the argument *before* you can see any inferences or assumptions.

## Distinguishing Fact from Conclusion

There are 3 ways to identify which statements are facts and which are conclusions:

1. Feel
1. Flow
1. Structural words

This list is ordered from worst to best. Feeling is the least reliable, and most cognitively expensive, strategy. Structural words offer the easiest and most reliable method.

### 1. Feel

Conclusions tend to seem more opinionated. While facts tend to be neutral.

Feelings however, can be manipulated by the LSAT. Facts can seem opinionated while the conclusion seems neutral.

### 2. Flow

All arguments have a direction: the facts support the conclusion.

When you read for the flow of the argument you may be tempted to think that the idea at the end is the conclusion. But the conclusion is just as often at the beginning or in the middle of the argument.

Flow is not about what words come first or last, it's about what supports what. 
- The *supporting* idea is the fact.
- The *supported* idea is the conclusion.

Flow is more reliable than feel, but it requires lots of *expensive thinking*.

### 3. Structural Words

Looking for structural words may feel less intuitive, at first. But ultimately structural words provides a low-brain-power and reliable way to distinguish the parts of an argument.

Structural Word | Common Examples
-- | --
Conclusion words | *Thus, therefore, so, hence*
Fact words | *For, after all, because, since*
Pivot words | *But, however, although, yet*

{% capture summary %}
Practice Idea: Memorize these structural words, then practice spotting them in the wild.
{% endcapture %}
{% capture details %}
Memorize structural words with flashcards. 

Then... 

1. Try reading some LSAT arguments with the sole purpose of identifying all of the structural words; and/or
2. Try finding structural words in the news. See if these structure words reveal hidden arguments. 
- Easy mode: news sources you typically disagree with. 
- Hard mode: news sources you typically agree with.

*Bonus: work with a partner to see if you missed anything they caught, or vice versa.*

Common structures:

- Antithesis. *But* fact. *So* conclusion.
- *Although* antithesis, conclusion. *After all* fact.
- *Because* fact, conclusion.
- Conclusion *since* fact.

## Examples

### Example 1: Fruit

    Bananas are the worst fruit. After all, every other fruit is better.

{% capture summary %}
What's the conclusion? How can you tell?
{% endcapture %}
{% capture details %}
Conclusion: `Bananas are the worst.`

The fact word `after all` shows that the second sentence is a fact, so the first must be the conclusion.

Note: This is a circular argument. The fact and the conclusion sentences both mean the exact same thing.
{% endcapture %}
{% include details.html %}

### Example 2: Intellectual Property

    Software companies argue that strong intellectual property protections are necessary to promote innovation. But there's plenty of innovation in clothing fashions even though fashion designs can't be patented or copyrighted. We don't need patent and copyright protections for software.

{% capture summary %}
What's the conclusion? How can you tell?
{% endcapture %}
{% capture details %}
Conclusion: `We don't need patent or copyright for software.`

The *pivot* word `but` typically comes after the antithesis. Since `but` is at the beginning of the second sentence that indicates that the first sentence is an *antithesis*.

As soon as you read that `but`, you can guess that the conclusion will be the opposite of whatever the software companies believe. The last sentence is opposite of the first, so that's our conclusion.

Reading for flow, you might also also notice that the second sentence supports the last.

Note: If we left the `but` in place, we could otherwise swap the order of the second and last sentence, and the meaning wouldn't change.

### Example 3: A Thief

    Although my client is a convicted thief, they didn't kill anyone.

{% capture summary %}
What's the conclusion? How can you tell?
{% endcapture %}
{% capture details %}
Conclusion: `They didn't kill anyone.`

The pivot word `although` typically comes before the antithesis. In this case, the antithesis is less of an argument than an inconvenient fact. The lawyer is using the word `although` to shift our attention away from that fact that their client has stolen in the past, and towards what they care about proving, that their client isn't a murderer.

Note: This isn't really an argument because there's no facts. It's more like an assertion.
{% endcapture %}

### Example 4: Gift Cards

    If you spend $100 at our store, we'll give you a $20 gift card.

{% capture summary %}
What's the conclusion? How can you tell?
{% endcapture %}
{% capture details %}
Conclusion: There isn't one.

This was a trick, sorry!

On the LSAT "If, Then"s are *conditional statements* not arguments.

### Example 5: Fred's Freedom

    If you care about freedom, then you'll vote for Fred. You didn't vote for Fred, so you don't care about freedom.

{% capture summary %}
What's the conclusion? How can you tell?
{% endcapture %}
{% capture details %}
Conclusion: `You don't care about freedom`

Fact 1: `Care about freedom â†’ vote Fred`

Fact 2: `No vote Fred`

The conclusion word `so` indicates that the very last phrase is the conclusion.

One of the facts here is a conditional statement. The other is a statement about the world that then sets off that conditional statement.

Note: Conditional statements can be either facts or conclusions.
