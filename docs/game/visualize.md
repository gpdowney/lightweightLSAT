Drawing games is a three-step process:

Step | Goal
-- | --
[Scan](#scan) | Determine the type of game
[Visualize](#visualize) | Get everything you know on paper
[Check](#check) | Prevent errors

[The end of this page includes timing tips and sample checklists for each step.](#timing)

## Scan

Before you start drawing, it can be useful to scan the game to get oriented.

> Note: your scan will become more productive as you become more familiar with games.

When you scan, you quickly glance at everything given on the first page of the game, including the first question.

**The goal of your scan is to extract clues about the shape of the game.**

Basically, ask yourself: *"Is this more ordered or more grouped?"*

Game Family | How to Recognize | How to Draw
Order | one element at a time <br> more 2D <br> rules order / rank the elements <br> first question says "acceptable order" | number line ![order drawing][order]
Group | multiple elements go with / in each group <br> more 3D <br> rules put elements together or keep them apart <br> *it's not ordered* | buckets ![group drawing][group]

This basic scan is all you need to do.

As you learn more about games, you can also ask: *"Which specific type of game does this most resemble?"*

When you're ready to add yet another layer of complexity, you can start to look for more detailed clues during your scan:

Variables | elements, groups, characteristics, categories, any other moving parts
Numbers | literal numbers, minimums, maximums
Splits | restrictions that limit the game to only 2 or 3 possibilities
Weirdos | something you haven't seen before

Noticing these details can help you shape your drawing correctly from the start.

To review, actually play the games and see if your guesses were useful.

## Visualize

Once you know the shape of the game, it's time to put pencil to paper.

**You draw in order to *visually represent* *all* of the information the LSAT gave you, *neatly* and *accurately*.**

Generally, your drawing will include three parts:

Board | the number line / buckets
Index | all of the elements
Rules | using simplified symbols

[Learn how to draw the common rules.][rules]

> Note: if my drawings don't work for you, invent your own or steal ideas from another guide. But don't waste your brainpower figuring out how to draw the basics every time.

Your drawing doesn't need to be perfectly beautiful or completely solve the game.

Your drawing shouldn't include any *guesses*. It just needs to clearly represent everything you *know* about the game.

> Sometimes thinking about what *could* happen in order to understand what *couldn't* happen. Understanding these constraints can help you understand how the game works.
> 
> Be careful. Thinking about *coulds* easily turns into staring, and staring is the time-killer. 
>
> Usually it's more efficient to think about *coulds* once you get to the questions.

### Splits

You can *split* a game when

1. it can only go two or three ways *and*
2. it's worth exploring all of those possibilities.

Splits are exhaustive, they don't represent some possibilities, they represent *every possibility*.

Drawing splits can be time intensive, but it can also reduce the complexity of a game by taking care of one or more rules.

[Learn more about splits.][splits]

### Connections

*Connections* happen when two rules can be combined into one or when a rule has secret implications.

> Beware: looking for connections easily becomes staring, and staring is the time killer.

If you happen to see a connection, you can...

1. Add it to your drawing, if it adds new information.
2. Combine two rules into one, as long as that combination doesn't destroy any information.

## Check

At minimum, the check is a chance to take a breath and collect yourself.

Your check can be more like a *double-check:* a chance to make sure you didn't write something backwards or mix up elements.

Or your check can be more like a *check-for:* a chance to try to understand how the game works.

The check is one of the most useful steps to experiment with. Try doing more and less checking to figure out what you need.

- What type of rules do you commonly mess up? For example, my brain likes to write orders backwards.
- What's easier for you to see in the scan vs. in the check? For example, it is technically more efficient to see splits during the scan, but they might be easier to spot after you've drawn something.
- Do you even need to check? I do, but maybe you don't.

Be honest about how your brain works in order develop a customized check checklist.

## Timing

Take exactly as much time as you need to *clearly* and *correctly* draw *everything.*

That said, when you draw faster, you can start getting points faster.

Some ways to draw faster:

- Memorize the common types + rules.
- Do less, like a shorter scan or more minimal drawing.
- Don't worry about splits and connections.
- Use checklists to avoid rushing and staring.

Test day goals:

Step | Common game types | Unusual or hard games
-- | --
Scan | 0:15 | 0:30
Visualize | 0:45 | 1:30
Check | 0:15 | 0:30
**Total** | **1:15** | **2:30**

## Sample Checklists

Short Scan:

1. Orders or groups?

Long Scan:

1. Orders or groups?
1. Common type?
1. Variables?
1. Numbers?
1. Splits?

Visualize:

1. Board
1. Rules
1. Index

Double-check:

1. Draw the leftovers, aka elements without rules.
1. Read each rule one-by-one to make sure your drawing is correct.
1. Glance at the set-up to make sure you've captured all the variables and numbers.
1. Breathe.

Check-for:

1. Breathe.
1. Any leftovers?
1. Any connections?
1. Any numeric deductions?
1. Any splits?
