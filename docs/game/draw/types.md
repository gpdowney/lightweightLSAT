# Game Types

There are 2 families of game--Order or Group.
Each family contains 4 common types.

Type | How To Recognize
-- | --
***Order*** | **one element at a time**
[Standard](#standard-order) | no funny business
[Unequal](#unequal-order) | too many elements or too many spots
[Flow](#flow-order) | every rule is a relationship
[Multi](#multi-order) | element + extra variable
***Group*** | **many elements go with/into each group**
[Fixed](#fixed-group) | groups of fixed size
[Flexi](#flexi-group) | groups of changing or unknown size
[Binary](#binary-group) | exactly 2 groups + every rule is a conditional
[Grid](#grid-group) | base + element + extra variable

!!! note

    If the drawings suggested below don't work for you, invent your own or steal ideas from another guide. 
    But you must memorize some way of visualizing the major types of games.
    You don't want to waste your time and brainpower figuring out how to draw the basics every time.

## Standard Order

There's no funny business in a standard order game. One spot per element and one element per spot.

Drawing: Minimal number-line. Even skip drawing the line if there's nothing to put on it.

![Standard drawing][standard]

Complications: None. They may be solvable, but because they're simple you don't need to solve them.
  
## Multi Order

Extra variable.

Drawing: Write above and below the number-line.

![Multi drawing][multi]

Complications: Index may be useful to note numeric information.
  
## Unequal Order

Too many elements or too many spots

Drawing:

- Too many elements: adapt your number-line.
- Too many spots: adapt your index.

![Unequal drawing][unequal]

Complications: Pay careful attention to the number information...

- Does each element/spot need to be used?
- How many could go in each Spot?
- Which elements will repeat and how much?
  
## Flow Order

The rules tie all of the elements together.

Drawing: A single flow-chart that connects every element.

![Flow drawing][flow]

Complications: You may need to make 2+ flow-charts (aka a [split]) when there are either/or rules. You can also split when there is exactly one conditional rule. If this gets too complicated, skip the flow-chart and play it like Standard Order.
  
## Fixed Group

Groups are of fixed size.

Drawing: Base below (or to the side of) lines for each space.

![Fixed drawing][fixed]

Complications: It's not always clear which variable is the group and which is the element. When it's unclear, it usually doesn't matter. Why not try it both ways?
  
## Flexi Group

Groups are of flexible size.

Drawing: Lines for each space that must be filled. Dots for each space that could be filled.

![Flexi drawing][flexi]

Complications: Since it's more open-ended, it may be more useful to get information onto the board.
  
## Binary Group

Binary groups games feature exactly 2 groups + only have conditional rules.

Drawing: Ledger.

![Binary drawing][binary]

Complications: Binary groups can also be either Fixed or Flexi.
  
## Grid Group

Grid groups have an extra variable.

Drawing: Label both the bottom and the sides.

![Grid drawing][grid]

Complications: That's complicated enough.

## Weirdos And Remixes

In some games, elements are both ordered and grouped. Some order games aren't ordered. Some group games are ordered. Some games are one-of-a-kind.

!!! Warning

    Do not waste your time learning how to approach weird games until you're close to perfect on the 8 common types.

Learning the common types will give you general purpose tools that you can use on the weird games. And knowing what's normal will help you see more clearly what's weird.

Conversely, knowing all the nuances of how to handle the hard cases risks complicating your approach to easier games. And learning the weird games gives you specific tools that only help on a rare type of game.
