# Connections

Connections happen when

1. 2 rules can be combined into 1 without losing any information, and/or
1. a rule has secret implications.

Look for connections if you see

- the same element in multiple rules
- elements limited in where they can go

!!! note "Terminology Note"

     You may have heard connections called "inferences" elsewhere.

!!! success "Connection"

    Rule 1: `A` is next to `B` == `(AB)`

    Rule 2: `B` is before `C` == `B-C`

    Connection 1 (combination): `(AB)-C`

    Connection 2 (implication): `C` can't go first or second

    Connection 3 (implication): `A` and `B` cannot go last

!!! failure "Not a connection"

    Rule 1 (alt): `A` is exactly one space away from `B` == `(A_B)`
    
    Rule 2: `B` is before `C` == `B-C`

    If you try to connect them, like `(A_B)-C` then you will lose important information.
    This wrongly makes it seem like `C` can't come in between `A` and `B`

The benefits of making connections are clear to most students. The additional information gained can help you answer questions more quickly.

!!! warning "Connections are magic"

    When you see connections it feels wonderful, but you can't force it.
    
    [Wizards] can easily waste time starting or become overly dependant on connections.

!!! tip "Start making hypos to reveal connections"

    Personally, I see connections more easily once I start playing the game.
    As I make a few hypotheticals, just following the rules one-by-one, I can start to notice that some of the rules tend to go together or that some limit the game more than others.

!!! note "Flashcard Suggestions"

    When you spot a connection, especially if you missed that connection at first, consider making a [flashcard] to help you spot that type of connection more easily next time.

    For example, you could generalize from the `(AB)-C` connections mentioned above to make these two flashcards:

    > 1: What are some order rules love to connect? / solid clouds + relatives
    > 
    > 2: What does the rule `A-B` imply? / `A` can't go last & `B` can't go first
