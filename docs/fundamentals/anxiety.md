# Test Anxiety

Anxiety is different than stress

Everyone is stressed by the LSAT. The LSAT is a challenging, high stakes test.

Stress can be productive. Stress can focus and motivate you.

If you interpret your stress as a good thing, then it might become useful.

## Anxiety is *Unproductive* Stress

Anxiety has as many causes and manifestations as there are human beings. But it has two common effects on the LSAT:

1. Anxiety distracts you.
2. Anxiety disrupts your game-plan.

Anxiety impairs test performance when it takes you away from solving the question in front of you.

And anxiety makes the test harder when it encourages reactive, rather than proactive, behavior.

For example, anxiety might lead you to...

- Rush. You just want to get it over with.
- Avoid practicing new skills. You crave the comfort of familiar methods, even if those old methods are likely to lead to the same old results.
- Set low expectations. You let the test beat you before you've even begun, because you think it will insulate you from disappointment.

## Avoid Practicing Anxiety

If you notice yourself feeling Anxious, overwhelmed, or distracted for any reason:

1. Stop.
2. [Reset][1].

When you're too anxious (or tired, or whatever) to practice right, don't practice.

Instead, exercise, drink water, nap, eat, meditate, or take care of business.

Try again when you can approach the questions with confidence and integrity.

That said, don't give up too fast or postpone studying just because you "don't feel like it." Sometimes you need to warm up to get in the mood.
