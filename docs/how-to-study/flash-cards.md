# Flash Cards

Make flashcards to capture all of your *knowledge*, aka anything you learn *about the test*.

## Anki

I strongly recommend using the **[Anki][1]** software to ensure you review your flashcards efficiently.

!!! tip "Anki tips"

    [This comic is the best explanation][2] of how spaced repetition systems, like Anki, help you learn better.

    [This video][3] can help you figure out what the Anki settings do and how you can adjust them. The [official manual][4] is also useful.

## Memorize everything you can

If something about the test is memorizable, memorize it.
Memorizing will save you precious time and brain-power on test day.

!!! example

    When you learn on [this page](/reason/) that there are 3 families of reasoning questions, 
    then you can make a flashcard to make sure that knowledge sticks in your brain:
    
    > "What are the 3 families of reasoning questions?" / "(1) argue; (2) describe; and (3) infer"

    When you review that card you may realize that you don't actually *understand* the differences.
    That tells you that you have more reading to do, and more flashcards to make, perhaps like:

    > "What distinguishes the describe family from the argue family?" / "You won't have to criticize the argument on describe Qs"

## Keep flash cards simple

As a general rule, stick to one idea per card.
That makes it easier to test your knowledge.
You can review cards more quickly.
And more clearly know: "Yes, I got this right" or: "No, I got this wrong."

!!! warning "Skills are harder to memorize"

    To memorize a skill, consider using the format: "When I see X / I will do Y."

    For more complex skills, consider making a [checklist][/fundamentals/checklists/] instead of a flashcard.

??? idea "Law School Connection"

    I wish I'd known about Anki before law school.
    You'll look like a savant in class if you make 1-3 flash-cards about the (a) holding, (b) key facts, and (c) core reasoning for every case you read.
