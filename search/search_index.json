They offer advice for handling every possible situation that has ever happened on an LSAT.</p> <p>In contrast, the lightweight LSAT aims to offer you with knowledge you can actually use on test day. It describes the patterns that frequently repeat on the LSAT, so that you can quickly recognize those common patterns and process them with the least brain-power possible. And it offers a set of flexible tools that you can adapt to any situation, using your full brain-power.</p> Example of a flexible tool offered by this guide <p>This page describes how to draw 8 types of game.</p> <p>The first thing to do when you encounter a new game is try to figure out which of the 8 types it is. Once you figure out the type, you immediately know how to start drawing it. This pattern recognition is key to speed on the test.</p> <p>But there are more than 8 game types. So why not memorize every type of game? Because the weirder types are usually remixes of the 8 most common types. This means you can adapt skills from easy games for the hard ones.</p> <p>The reverse isn't true. The lessons from a hard game wont help you on an easier game. In fact, focusing on hard games may hurt your performance and speed by making you overthink the easier stuff. And since every hard game is unique, the specific way you need to approach one hard game is unlikely to help you on other hard games.</p>"},{"location":"#what-are-my-bona-fides-who-am-i-to-tell-you-how-to-study-for-the-lsat","title":"What are my bona fides?

When they get to the lagoon they stop to appreciate their swans. Over the years, they've happily seen every ugly duckling grow up into a white swan.</p> <p>This morning, based on their observations, the Duke has formulated a new law of nature:</p> <p>Swans must be white.</p> <p>The Duke comes to you, their trusty advisor, and asks: \"Should I reveal my discovery to the world?\"</p> <p>What do you say?</p> <p>Perhaps you're inclined to be agreeable with your boss. But remember that the Duke hates to be embarrassed. You'll lose more than your job if you agree with them now and they're later proven wrong.</p> <p>But if you're going to be critical you must also be careful and respectful. You can't simply say \"pshaw\" to the Duke. You must prove your case methodically.</p> <p>Now, think fast! There is a correct move here.</p> Would it be wiser for you to take a critical or an agreeable stance? <p>Be critical!</p> <p>Consider: what would it take to prove the Duke correct?</p> <p>To be agreeable, you'd need to definitively prove that all swans are white. To do that, you'd have find every single swan that has or will ever exist. On that journey, you might find millions of white swans. But as soon as you find a single black swan, it's all over. One non-white swan and the Duke is proved wrong. So, in this case, being agreeable sets you up for hard work that was unlikely to succeed.</p> <p>It would have been more efficient if you'd went looking for a black swan (or a grey or blue or pink swan or any non-white swan). You should have been critical.</p> <p>Later that afternoon, chastened by your wise disproof of their absolute claim about swans, the Duke proposes a new law of nature based on their lagoon observations:</p> <p>Ducks can be green.</p> Again, think fast! Should you be critical or agreeable? <p>Be agreeable!</p> <p>Perhaps you thought this time the Duke was trying to make a fool out of you, to see if you'd agree to a ridiculous claim. You've seen brown ducks, but green ones?? Being critical worked well last time. Why not try again?</p> <p>You should not be critical because, in this case, the Duke has taken a secure position.</p> <p>Consider: what would it take to prove the Duke wrong?</p> <p>You couldn't just find those brown ducks you saw before. Just because a duck CAN BE brown doesn't mean it CAN'T BE green. This time, being critical would require finding all the ducks and making sure they aren't green.</p> <p>So this time, it is wiser to be agreeable. Go over to the lagoon and check. As soon as you find one green duck, you can safely confirm that the Duke is correct.</p> <p>So what's the difference between these two theories?</p> <p>When the Duke says something MUST BE the case, it's easier to be critical.</p> <p>When the Duke says something COULD BE the case, it's easier to be agreeable.</p> <p>Quiz yourself.

But it kept crashing and killing the most experienced pilots. It couldn't be flown.</p> <p>Despite the risks, a group of test pilots kept after the problem:</p> <p>What they decided not to do was almost as interesting as what they actually did. They did not require Model 299 pilots to undergo longer training... Instead, they came up with an ingeniously simple approach: they created a pilot's checklist. Its mere existence indicated how far aeronautics had advanced. In the early years of flight, getting an aircraft into the air might have been nerve-racking but it was hardly complex. Using a checklist for takeoff would no more have occurred to a pilot than to a driver backing a car out of the garage. But flying this new plane was too complicated to be left to the memory of any one person, however expert.</p> <p>The test pilots made their list simple, brief, and to the point\u2014short enough to fit on an index card, with step-by-step checks for takeoff, flight, landing, and taxiing. It had the kind of stuff that all pilots know to do. They check that the brakes are released, that the instruments are set, that the door and windows are closed, that the elevator controls are unlocked\u2014dumb stuff.

Rude doctors have worse patient outcomes. When doctors are too quick to diagnose, they're likely to miss important context. Good doctors listen curiously.</p> <p>Good doctors use pattern recognition to structure how they listen. They see a kid with a runny nose, and their pattern recognition thinks: \"Ok, cold or flu.\" But then the kid is like: My ankle hurts. So the good doctor shifts gears, now they look out for hurt-ankle patterns.</p> <p>Similarly, a lawyers' fundamental task is to listen to a client's story, and then translate that story into a legal claim.</p> <p>A good lawyer uses their knowledge of the law and experience to spot issues. They hear \"my neighbor is so annoying, they keep parking in front of my house, and they even ran over my cat.\" They filter out the parts of the story that the law can't do anything about, like where the annoying neighbor parks, so they can focus on actionable issues, like the cat.</p>"},{"location":"reason/argue/#right-and-wrong-answers","title":"Right and wrong answers","text":"<p>There are 3 common types of wrong answers in the ARGUE family:</p> <ol> <li>Backwards: helps the argument when you were supposed to hurt it (or vice versa).</li> <li>Irrelevant: doesn't address the argument's problem.</li> <li>Confused: mixes up the argument's ideas.</li> </ol> <p>There is only ever one correct answer</p> <p>4 of the answers have no effect or the wrong effect.</p> <p>On MECHANICAL-HELP questions, the correct answer will not include new ideas.
