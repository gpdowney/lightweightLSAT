- name: easy LIST
  ex: Which of the following could be a complete and accurate list...?
  know: Usually the 1st Q.
  process: |
    - Use each Rule, one by one, to eliminate Answers.
    - Usually each Rule will eliminate one Answer.
    - Sometimes you can use Connected Rules to eliminate more than one Answer.
    - The correct Answer is a valid HYPO, write it down.
  adv: |

    - Use these Qs to practice smoothly consulting one Rule at a time.
    - To increase smoothness, know what you're looking for in the Answer before you look.
    - Or don't expect smoothness, and use these Qs to learn how the Rules work.

- name: easy IF
  ex: If X is in 3, then which of the following...?
  know: Gives a clear starting point for creating a HYPO.
  process: |
    1. Draw a new Board with the new info.
    1. Follow the next, overlapping Rule.
    1. Add new info to the Board.
    1. Repeat Steps 2 + 3 to exhaustion (of the Rules).
    1. Ask "Who's Left?"
  adv: When you add new info to the board, check to see if you can select or eliminate any Answers. 

- name: DOMINOS
  ex: Which of the following, if true, completely determines the position of every other element?
  know: The correct Answer will make everything fall into place, like dominos.
  process: |
    - Test each Answer by making a new Board and following the overlapping Rules one by one.
    - As soon as there's a option (something "could be" here or there), move on to the next Answer.
  adv: Start testing with Answers that put restricted Elements in restrictive places.


- name: hard IF
  ex: |
    If X is before Y, then which one of the following...

    > If X is not in 3, then which one of the following...
  know: The new info can't go on the Board or it doesn't lead to a useful HYPO.
  process: |
    - Mini-Splits: often the new info will limit the Game to 2-3 options, which you could Split.
    - When the new Info is a new Rule, don't worry about putting it on the Board. Write the new Rule down, then connect other Rules...
    - When all else fails, pretend it's a WHICH Q (but don't forget the new info).
  adv: | 
    Some Qs that look like RULE SUB Qs are actually hard IF Qs.

    > If the rule that "A must be first" is replaced by the rule that "B must be first", then which one of the following...

    For these Qs, draw a new board with the new info (here, put B in 1) and follow all the rules except the replaced rule (here, ignore "A in 1").

- name: WHICH
  ex: |
    Which one of the following must be false?

    > Which of the following could be true?
  know:
  process: |
    1. Use your old HYPOS to prove or disprove answers.
    1. Wizard: Stare at the Answers to see if any are obviously correct or incorrect. Note: Wizarding is not guessing. And you're only allowed to Wizard for 10 seconds.
    1. Make new HYPOS to prove or disprove each remaining answer.
  adv: | 
    Test Answers strategically:
    - On MUST Qs: start testing the Answers you think are wrong.
    - On COULD Qs: start testing the Answers you think are right.

- name: hard LIST
  ex: Which of the following is a complete and accurate list of the places that X could go?
  know: |
    Notice the difference between easy and hard LIST Qs...
    - easy LIST = "what could be a list" (one example)
    - hard LIST = "list of what could be" (all the possibilities)
  process: |
    - Collect the relevant info from valid HYPOS (here, where X has gone).
    - Eliminate incomplete Answers (if you've seen X in 2 and 3, you can eliminate any Answer that doesn't include both 2 and 3).
    - Make new HYPOS to test the remaining Answers.

  adv: These are advanced enough!


- name: RULE SUB
  ex: "Which of the following rules, if substituted for the rule that X comes before Y, would have the same effect?"
  know:
  process: |
    1. Use your old HYPOS to eliminate CBF Answers.
    1. Translate the new Rules (the Rules in the Answers) to see if any merely rephrase the old Rule.
    1. Guess
  adv: |
    Disprove remaining Answers by creating a HYPO that...
    1. Follows the new Rule and
    1. Breaks the old Rule, but
    1. Follows all the other Rules.
