- name: Standard
  family: Order
  know: There's no funny business in a standard order game. One spot per element and one element per spot.
  set-up: Minimal number-line. Even skip drawing the line if there's nothing to put on it.
  complications: None. They may be solvable, but because they're simple you don't need to solve them.
  
- name: Multi
  family: Order
  know: Extra variable.
  set-up: Write above and below the number-line.
  complications: Index may be useful to note [numeric](../glossary.html/#numeric) information.
  
- name: Unequal
  family: Order
  know: Too many elements or too many spots
  set-up: |
    Depends... 
    - Too many elements: adapt your number-line.
    - Too many spots: adapt your index.
  complications: |
    Pay careful attention to the [numeric](glossary.html/#numeric) information...
    - Does each element/spot need to be used?
    - How many could go in each Spot?
    - Which elements will repeat and how much?
  
- name: Flow
  family: Order
  know: The rules tie all of the elements together.
  set-up: A single flow-chart that connects every element.
  complications: You may need to make 2+ flow-charts (aka a [split](splits.html)) when there are either/or rules. You can also split when there is exactly one conditional rule. If this gets too complicated, skip the flow-chart and play it like Standard Order.
  
- name: Fixed
  family: Group
  know: Groups are of fixed size.
  set-up: Base below (or to the side of) lines for each space.
  complications: It's not always clear which variable is the group and which is the element. When it's unclear, it usually doesn't matter. Why not try it both ways?
  
- name: Flexi
  family: Group
  know: Groups are of flexible size.
  set-up: Lines for each space that must be filled. Dots for each space that could be filled.
  complications: Since it's more open-ended, it may be more useful to get information onto the board.
  
- name: Binary
  family: Group
  know: Exactly 2 groups + only conditional rules.
  set-up: Ledger.
  complications: Binary groups can be either Fixed or Flexi.
  
- name: Grid
  family: Group
  know: Extra variable.
  set-up: Label both the bottom and the sides.
  complications: That's complicated enough.
