- name: Standard
  family: Order
  know: There's no funny business in a Standard Order Game. One spot per element and one element per spot.
  set-up: Minimal Number-line. Skip drawing the line unless there's stuff to put on it.
  complications: None. They may be more solvable during Set-Up, but because they're more straightforward you also don't need to solve them.
  
- name: Multi
  family: Order
  know: Extra Variable.
  set-up: Write above and below the Number-line.
  complications: Index may be useful to note number information.
  
- name: Unequal
  family: Order
  know: Too many Elements or too many Spots
  set-up: |
    Depends... 
    - Too many Elements: Adapt your Number-line.
    - Too many Spots: Adapt your Index.
  complications: |
    Pay careful attention to the Numbers...
    - Does each Element/Spot need to be used?
    - How many could go in each Spot?
    - Which Elements will repeat and how much?
  
- name: Flow
  family: Order
  know: The Rules tie all of the Elements together.
  set-up: A single flow-chart that connects every Element.
  complications: You may need to make 2+ flow-charts (aka a Split) when there are either/or Rules. You can also split when there is exactly one Conditional Rule. If this gets too complicated, skip the flow-chart and play it like Standard Order.
  
- name: Fixed
  family: Group
  know: Groups are of fixed size.
  set-up: Base below (or to the side of) lines for each space.
  complications: It's not always clear what's the Group and what's the Element. When it's unclear, it usually doesn't matter. Why not try it both ways?
  
- name: Flexi
  family: Group
  know: Groups are of flexible size.
  set-up: Lines for each space that must be filled. Dots for each space that could be filled.
  complications: Since it's more open-ended, it may be more useful to force information onto the Board.
  
- name: Binary
  family: Group
  know: Exactly 2 Groups + only Conditional Rules.
  set-up: Ledger with In vs Out.
  complications: Binary groups can be either Fixed or Flexi.
  
- name: Grid
  family: Group
  know: Extra variable.
  set-up: Label both the bottom and the sides.
  complications: That's complicated enough.
