- species: all describe qs
  family: describe 
  genus: "-"
  clues: asks what the argument did
  job: |
    Don't argue, just understand.

    Match ideas (not words).
  tips: |
    Most Describe questions are semi-MECHANICAL. You should make Specific Predictions, but all you need to do to make that Prediction is to Understand the Argument.

    Pivot and Fact keywords will be useful, but Conclusion keywords will be untrustworthy.

    Beware Sub-Conclusions. They look like a Conclusion, walk like a Conclusion, quack like a Conclusion, but they actually support another Conclusion.

    Fill in pronouns, resolve double negatives, and watch out for commas.

    Let it be easy when it's easy.

- species: conclusion
  family: describe 
  genus: mechanical
  clues: |
    > ...describes the main point
    >
    > ...is the conclusion
  job: Find the Conclusion sentence. Find the same essential ideas in the correct Answer.
  tips: Presume that the Conclusion is *not* the last sentence, and do *not* trust Conclusion keywords.

- species: role
  family: describe 
  genus: mechanical
  clues: "> *blah blah blah* plays which one of the following roles/functions..."
  job: Define the Relationship (DTR) between the Blah and the Conclusion.
  tips: Ignore the blah blah blah, at first. Eliminate Answers that are mistaken about either (a) the Conclusion or (b) their relationship.

- species: parallel
  family: describe 
  genus: mechanical
  clues: |
    > parallels the reasoning
    >
    > uses the same reasoning as above
  job: Abstract the structure (ignore the content).
  tips: |
    The order of words does not matter.

    Smell Test = if you're looking for a bad Argument, get rid of good Answers. If you're looking for a solid Argument, get rid of flawed Answers.

    [Count Count](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMrr6s8CSDo) = the correct Answer must have the same number and type of Facts and the same type of Conclusion. Imagine yourself saying "1 conditional, 2 conditional, a conditional Conclusionâ€¦ Hahaha"


- species: all argue qs
  family: argue 
  genus: "-"
  clues: the Argument has a Problem
  job: |
    Identify the Problem with the Argument by finding Flaws, What Ifs or Gaps.

    Eliminate Answers Irrelevant to the Problem, and Answers that Hurt when you wanted to Help (or Help when you want to Hurt).
  tips: Pay careful attention to Genus in the Argue Fam. Help (Organic) and Justify (Mechanical) might seem similar, but they require very different approaches.

- species: hurt
  family: argue 
  genus: organic
  clues: |
    > Which of the following, if true, most weakens the argument?
    > 
    > ...expresses a flaw in the reasoning
    > 
    > The argument is most vulnerable to the criticism that it...
  job: Point out or exploit the Argument's problem. Make the Argument worse.
  tips: |
    The correct Answer doesn't need to be completely devastating. It only needs to have some negative effect.
    
    There is only one correct Answer. All of the other Answers are either irrelevant or helpful.
    
    Eliminate "it didn't do that" Answers. If you find a common Flaw, eliminate Answers that address a different Flaw.

- species: help
  family: argue 
  genus: organic
  clues: |
    > Which of the following, if true, most strengthens the argument?
    >
    > Which one of the following would, if true, help most to explain the result described above?"
  job: Address the Argument's Problem. Make the Conclusion slightly more likely. Better connect a loose Facts to the Conclusion.
  tips: Help-Explain questions don't give full Arguments. They give two seemingly opposed Facts. You Help by explaining why the Facts actually go together.

- species: justify
  family: argue 
  genus: mechanical
  clues: |
    > Which one of the following, if true, allows the conclusion of the argument to be properly drawn?
    >
    > ...makes the conclusion logically valid?
    >
    > Which of the following principles would most help to justify the argument above?
  job: Find the Gap. Completely connect the Facts to the Conclusion so there's no doubt.
  tips: |
    Know exactly what ideas need to be linked before you look at the Answers.
    
    A new idea in the Conclusion must be defined in the correct Answer.

- species: depends
  family: argue 
  genus: both
  clues: |
    > Which one of the following is an assumption on which the argument depends?
    >
    > ...does the argument require?
    >
    > ...is an assumption necessary for the argument to be valid?
  job: |
    It depends... do you see a clear Gap?
    
    If yes, approach MECHANICALLY (like a JUSTIFY question).
    
    If no, approach ORGANICALLY (like a HELP question).
  tips: Always Negate the Answer you like.

- species: all infer qs
  family: infer 
  genus: "-"
  clues: There's no Argument, just Facts.
  job: Find connections.
  tips: Diagram on MECHANICAL/INFER questions, look for MODEST Answers on ORGANIC/INFER questions.

- species: most supported
  family: infer 
  genus: organic
  clues: |
    > Most supported by the information above
    >
    > Most logically completes the argument
    >
    > Can be inferred from the statements given
  job: Pick the allowable combination of the given facts. Know what you Know and don't go beyond that.
  tips: |
    Modest statements are easier to prove, and therefore more likely to follow from what's been given.

    Usually the correct Answer will combine information from multiple Facts (not merely restate one Fact).

    You can refer back the Facts to double-check or eliminate Answers. (Although this is time intensive.)

- species: disagree
  family: infer 
  genus: organic
  clues: |
    > most likely to agree about
    >
    > would be most likely to disagree on
  job: Find the overlap between the two speakers.
  tips:  |
    The second speaker will often say what they (dis)agree with.
    
    The correct Answer doesn't have to be the main point, just something they both address.
    
    The overlap can be a slight inference, so favor Modest Answers.

    Note Agree vs Disagree.

    Just because there's two speakers doesn't mean it's this question Species.

- species: must be true
  family: infer 
  genus: mechanical
  clues: |
    > Which of the following must be true based on the above?

    Or! It looks like a MOST SUPPORTED question, but it features either
    - Conditional logic, or
    - Chained causation, or
    - Linkable, repeated ideas.
  job: Draw a diagram to combine the Facts.
  tips:  |
    Use the Contrapositives.
    
    If there's conditionals, ignore everything that isn't Conditional.

- species: must be false
  family: infer 
  genus: mechanical
  clues: "> Which of the following must be false based on the above?"
  job: Find the absolute statement, then contradict it.
  tips: Ignore the interesting bits. Focus only on the absolutes.

- species: rule
  family: infer 
  genus: mechanical
  clues: |
    > Which of the following examples conforms to the principles stated above?
    >
    > Which of the following violates the principle stated above?
  job: |
    1. Diagram the Rules.
    2. Eliminate unprovable Answers.
    3. Select the Answer that follows the rules.
  tips: |
    Answers are only provable if they're trying to prove the [right side of the arrow](conditionals.html#rulediagram).

    For "violates the principle" questions, pick the Answer that breaks the Rules (don't pick an Irrelevant answer).
