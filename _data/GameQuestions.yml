- name: LIST
  ex: Which of the following could be a complete and accurate list...?
  ask: Which of the answers doesn't break any rule?
  know: Usually the 1st question.
  short: Go rule-by-rule. Use each rule to eliminate one answer.
  process: |
    - Use each rule, one by one, to eliminate answers.
    - Usually each rule will eliminate one answer.
    - The correct answer is a valid hypo, write it down.
  adv: |

    - Use these questions to practice smoothly consulting one rule at a time.
    - To increase smoothness, know what you're looking for in the answer before you look.
    - Or don't expect smoothness, and use these questions to learn how the rules work.

- name: IF
  ex: If X is in 3, then which of the following...?
  ask: In this specific situation, what do the rules require (or allow)?
  know: Gives a starting point for creating a hypo.
  short: Add the new information to a new board, then follow the rules to make a new hypo.
  process: |

    1. Draw a new board with the new info.
    1. Follow the next, overlapping rule.
    1. Add new info to the board.
    1. Repeat steps 2 + 3 to exhaustion (of the rules).
    1. Ask "who's left?"
  adv: |

    - When you add new info to the board, check to see if you can select or eliminate any answers. 
    - Alternatively: finish the hypo, even if you don't need to in order to make it more useful for future questions. Use clouds to get all the elements on the board.
  importance: major

- name: WHICH
  ex: Which of the following must be false?
  ask: Across all possible situations, what could (or must) happen?
  know:
  short: Reuse old hypos. Make new hypos to test remaining answers, if needed.
  process: |
    1. Reuse your hypos to prove or disprove answers.
    1. Wizard: Stare at the answers to see if any are obviously correct or incorrect. Note: Wizarding is not guessing. And you're only allowed to Wizard for 10 seconds.
    1. Make new hypos to prove or disprove each remaining answer.
  adv: | 
    Test answers strategically...
    - For *must be*: start testing the answers you think are wrong.
    - For *could be*: start testing the answers you think are right.
  importance: major

- name: DOMINOS
  ex: Which of the following, if true, completely determines the position of every other element?
  know: The correct answer will make everything fall into place, like dominos.
  short: Test until one answer makes every element fall into place.
  process: |
    1. Test each answer by making a new board and following the overlapping rules one by one.
    1. As soon as there's a option (something "could be" here or there), move on to the next answer.
  adv: Start testing with answers that put restricted elements in restrictive places.
  importance: minor

- name: hard IF
  ex: If X is before Y, then which one of the following...
  know: The new info can't go on the board or it doesn't lead to a useful hypo.
  short: Make mini-splits based on the new information.
  process: |
    - Mini-splits: often the new info will limit the Game to 2-3 options, which you could split.
    - When the new Info is a new rule, don't worry about putting it on the board. Write the new rule down, then connect other rules...
    - When all else fails, pretend it's a WHICH question (but don't forget the new info).
  adv: | 
    Some questions that look like SUBSTITUTE questions are actually hard IF questions.

    > If the rule that "A must be first" is replaced by the rule that "B must be first", then which one of the following...

    For these questions, draw a new board with the new info (here, put B in 1) and follow all the rules except the replaced rule (here, ignore "A in 1").
  importance: minor

- name: hard LIST
  ex: Which of the following is a complete and accurate list of the places that X could go?
  know: |
    Notice the difference between LIST and hard LIST questions...
    - LIST = "what could be a list" (one example)
    - hard LIST = "list of what could be" (all the possibilities)
  short: Reuse old hypos to eliminate incomplete answers.
  process: |
    1. Collect the relevant info from valid hypos (here, where X has gone).
    1. Eliminate incomplete answers (if you've seen X in 2 and 3, you can eliminate any answer that doesn't include both 2 and 3).
    1. Make new hypos to test the remaining answers.
  adv: These are advanced enough!
  importance: minor

- name: SUBSTITUTE
  ex: "Which of the following rules, if substituted for the rule that X comes before Y, would have the same effect?"
  know:
  short: Skip.
  process: |
    1. Use your old hypos to eliminate answers that *could be false*.
    1. Translate the new rules (the rules in the answers) to see if any merely rephrase the old rule.
    1. Guess
  adv: |
    Disprove remaining answers by creating a hypo that...
    1. Follows the new rule and
    1. Breaks the old rule, but
    1. Follows all the other rules.
