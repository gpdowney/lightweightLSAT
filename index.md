*The Lightweight LSAT* outlines a proven and simple system for mastering the Law School Admissions Test.

## The LSAT is different

Studying for the LSAT can really suck. 

One reason it sucks is that the LSAT is unlike most other tests that you've taken. Most other standardized tests and exams in school are *tests of knowledge*. In contrast, the LSAT is a *test of skill*.

If you study for the LSAT in the same way you studied for those other tests, you're going to have a bad time.

And, unfortunately, most other guides to the LSAT make things worse by overloading you with knowledge about the test.

That's why I wrote this guide. *The Lightweight LSAT* takes a different approach to preparing for the LSAT.

*The Lightweight LSAT* provides only the most essential knowledge, so that you can instead focus on building the fundamental skills you need to master the test.

If you're used to studying for knowledge tests, my skill-focused method may feel uncomfortable or incomplete. But I hope you can stick with me, and in practicing this method, find a more productive and even enjoyable way to study for the LSAT.

## The LSAT is learnable

The LSAT tests a specific set of learnable skills.

There are three fundamental skills to mastering the LSAT, one for each of the three sections:

Test Section | Primarily tests your ability to...
-- | --
Games | *methodically follow a set of rules <br> one-by-one*
Reading | *identify what the author of a short passage is for and against*
Reasoning | *break down arguments by clarifying fact from conclusion*

If you can master these three major tasks, then you can correctly answer every question on the test within the time constraints.

Most of remainder of this guide offers a set of minor skills that help you accomplish these major tasks.

And, more importantly, *the Lightweight LSAT* offers an iterative and intentional method for effectively practicing skills.

## *The Lightweight LSAT* is minimalist

This guide focuses on only the essential knowledge.

For example, it describes how to...

- draw the 8 types of games
- approach the 3 types of reading questions
- recognize the 5 types of reasoning flaws

Each of these lists is intentionally incomplete. There are certainly more than 5 flaws. The 3 reading question "types" are actually more like a spectrum. And the 8 game types can hybridize, combining into new forms.

By keeping things simple, however, *the Lightweight LSAT* gives you a set of knowledge you can *actually use* on test day. 

It trusts you to figure out the complications, additions, nuances, and exceptions as you practice.

Rather than offering inflexible rules that guide you through every possible situation (which is both impossible and burdensome), *the Lightweight LSAT* offers simple heuristics that can help you adapt to any situation.

## *The Lightweight LSAT* works

Together, the knowledge and skills described in this guide compose a complete system for approaching the LSAT. 

This system reflects my more than 5 years of experience teaching the LSAT for a luxury test prep company. And it describes the actual system I used to score a 180 (a perfect score) on the March 2020 LSAT.

But your brain is unique. So you should adapt my system for your needs.

Here are some tips for making the *The Lightweight LSAT* work for you:
- Test out my ideas. Experiment with them on real LSAT questions. 
- Start small. Try out new skills one question at a time and without a timer.
- Pay attention to what you can control: your *process*, meaning how you approach each question.
- Don't expect ease or perfect results at first. Do expect to get smoother, more confident, and more reliable.
- Try to make your process perfect on easy questions. Then gradually add in difficulty.
- Treat your results (aka whether you got the question right or wrong, and how long it took you) as information about whether your process is working, rather than making your results into a judgement about your worth as a human being.
- Jump ahead. Explore the parts of the guide that most interest you.
- Circle back. Revisit sections of the guide you already read to see if there's any nuance you missed the first time.
- Discard anything that doesn't help you.

## This is version 0.5 of the guide.

In other words, this is the fifth draft. There's room to improve. 

And *you* can help improve it!
