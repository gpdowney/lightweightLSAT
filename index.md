*The Lightweight LSAT* outlines a proven and simple system for mastering the Law School Admissions Test.

## The LSAT is a learnable test of skill

Let's be clear, the LSAT sucks. And, unfortunately, most other guides make things worse by overloading you with knowledge *about* the test.

To be fair, memorizing the LSAT's common patterns is useful. But, unlike most other tests you've taken, the LSAT does not really test your knowledge. Nor does it test your intelligence or your worth as a human being. 

Rather, the LSAT tests a specific set of **learnable skills**.

For example:

- The Games section primarily tests your ability to methodically follow rules one-by-one. 
- The Reading section primarily tests your capacity to identify what the author of a short passage is for and against.
- The Reasoning section primarily tests your ability to break down arguments, clarifying fact from conclusion.

*The Lightweight LSAT* teaches you how to hone these and the other skills essential to success.

## *The Lightweight LSAT* is minimalist

This guide focuses on the essentials.

For example:

- The guide describes how to draw the 8 types of games.
- The guide outlines how to approach the 3 types of reading questions.
- The guide lists how to recognize 5 types of reasoning flaws.

Each of these lists are intentionally incomplete. There are certainly more than 5 flaws. The 8 game types can hybridize, and combine into new forms. And the 3 reading question "types" are actually more like a spectrum.

But by keeping things simple, *the Lightweight LSAT* gives you a set of knowledge you can actually use on test day.

It trusts you to figure out the complications, additions, nuances, and exceptions as you practice.

## *The Lightweight LSAT* works

This site describes the actual system I used to score a 180 on the March 2020 LSAT. And it reflects my more than 5 years experience teaching the LSAT for a luxury test prep company.

But your brain is unique. So you should adapt my ideas to your needs. 
- Learn how the system works--and what works for you--by experimenting on real LSAT questions. 
- Start small. Try out new methods one question at a time, without a timer. Make your process perfect on easy questions. Then add in difficulty gradually.
- Don't expect perfection or ease, especially at first. Do expect to get smoother, more confident, and more reliable.
- Discard anything that doesn't help you.

## This is version 0.5 of the guide

In other words, this is the fifth draft. There's room to improve. You can help improve it.
