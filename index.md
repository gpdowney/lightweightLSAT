*The Lightweight LSAT* is a free guide to the Law School Admissions Test.

It's lightweight because it describes only the essential skills. 

(That means you'll need to teach yourself more, which is a good thing.)

## I'm qualified to write this guide because...

I graduated from Yale Law School in 2016.

I taught the LSAT with Manhattan Prep for 4 years.

In October 2011, on the old paper test, I scored 173.

In May 2020, on the new at-home digital test, I scored 180.

## This guide proposes one System for mastering the LSAT

**A useful System productively channels your good intuitions and corrects your bad intuitions.**

A really useful System might make studying fun.

There is no System that can guarantee you the right Answers.

And everyone's brain is different. The important question is: What helps you be smoother?

## This is version 0.3 of the guide

In other words, it's the third draft. There's room to improve.

You can help improve it. Send complaints and compliments to feedback@lightweightlsat.com.

## To get the most from this guide...

### 1. Begin with the Fundamentals

If you're new to the Test, [LSAT Basics](basics.html) provides an overview.

Learn the [Pitfalls](pitfalls.html) so you can avoid them.

When you're ready to go, dive in with one of the [3 Types of Practice](practice.html).

### 2. Explore

You can read this guide top to bottom, or you can take just the pieces you need.

If you don't know what you need, [take a Practice Test](https://lawhub.lsac.org/). Don't be afraid to fail. Failure is the very best teacher.

### 3. Experiment

Don't reject or accept my ideas until you've tried them out on a real Q.

*Beware: At first, learning any System (even a lightweight one) will make the Test feel harder and slower.*

Stick with me, but not mindlessly. There could be many reasons something isn't working. You might be applying the right skill, but in the wrong place. Or you might be applying it correctly, but it's just not right for you.

Scrap whatever you don't need. And whatever you do keep, make it your own. Rephrase, adapt, amend, and recombine my ideas for your own purposes.

Make your own System. And always calibrate your System against the Test. If it doesn't help you on a real LSAT Q, it's not helpful.
