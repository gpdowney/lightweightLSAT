*The Lightweight LSAT* is a complete and completely free guide to the Law School Admissions Test.

This site offers a minimalist system for mastering the LSAT.

Unlike other guides, which overload you with knowledge about the Test, *the Lightweight LSAT* emphasizes intentional and iterative skill-building.

This guide purposefully leaves out many nuances in order to (a) focus on the most essential skills and (b) encourage you to teach yourself.

This site expects you to revise, adapt, expand, and simplify *the Lightweight LSAT* system based on your experience on actual LSAT Qs. (Actual Qs are not provided here, as they are available [directly from LSAC](https://lawhub.lsac.org).)

It's not for everyone. Everyone's brain is differently. Everyone learns differently.

## My Bona Fides

In March 2020, I scored **180** on the LSAT (a perfect score). That was my second official test. The first time, in October 2010, I scored 173 (a top 1% score).

I've taught the LSAT for 5 years, formerly with Manhattan Prep and now with the [Test Prep Collective](https://testprepcollective.com).

In 2016, I graduated from Yale Law School.

## This is version 0.3 of the guide

In other words, it's the third draft. There's room to improve.

## To get the most from this guide...

### 1. Begin with the Fundamentals

If you're new to the Test, [LSAT Basics](basics.html) provides an overview.

Try out one or two of my [Favorite Skills](skills.html).

Learn the [Pitfalls](pitfalls.html) so you can avoid them.

When you're ready to dig deeper, learn the [3 Types of Practice](practice.html).

### 2. Explore

Read this guide top to bottom, or take just the pieces you need.

If you don't know what you need, [take a Practice Test](https://lawhub.lsac.org/). Don't be afraid to fail. Failure is the very best teacher.

Jump around to the topics that interest you. And re-read, too. As your skill improves, the meaning of my words might become clearer or change.

### 3. Experiment

Don't reject or accept my ideas until you've tried them out on a real Q.

Always calibrate your system against the Test. If my method doesn't make *you* smoother and more confident on real LSAT Qs, it's not helpful for *you*, so you should try a different approach.

*Beware: At first, learning any system (even a lightweight one) will make the Test feel harder and slower.*

Stick with me, but not mindlessly. There could be many reasons something isn't working. You might be applying the right skill, but in the wrong place. Or you might be applying it correctly, but it's just not right for you.

Scrap whatever you don't need. And whatever you do keep, make it your own. Rephrase, adapt, amend, and recombine my ideas for your own purposes.
