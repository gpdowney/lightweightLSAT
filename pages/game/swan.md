To prove and disprove Answers in Logic Games, you must think in a way that's unnatural for human brains.

A story might help:

Every day, the Viceroy looks over their estate. When they get to the lagoon they stop to appreciate their swans. Over the years, they've happily seen every ugly duckling grow up into a white swan.

This morning, based on their observations, the Viceroy has formulated a new law of nature:

> Swans must be white.

The Viceroy comes to you, their trusty advisor, and asks: "Should I reveal my discovery to the world?"

What do you say?

Perhaps you're inclined to be AGREEABLE with your boss. But remember that the Viceroy hates to be embarrassed. You'll lose more than your job if you agree with them now and they're later proven wrong.

But if you're going to be CRITICAL you must also be careful and respectful. You can't simply say: "pshaw" to the Viceroy. You must prove your case methodically.

Now, think fast! There is a correct move here.

{% capture summary %}
Would it be wiser for you to take a CRITICAL or an AGREEABLE stance?
{% endcapture %}

{% capture details %}
> Be CRITICAL!
{% endcapture %}

{% include details.html %}

Consider: what would it take to prove the Viceroy correct?

To be AGREEABLE, you'd need to definitively prove that all swans are white. To do that, you'd have find every single swan that has or will ever exist. On that journey, you might find millions of white swans. But as soon as you find a single black swan, it's all over. One non-white swan and the Viceroy is proved wrong. So, in this case, being AGREEABLE sets you up for hard work that was unlikely to succeed. 

It would have been more efficient if you'd went looking for a black swan (or a grey or blue or pink swan or any non-white swan). You should have been CRITICAL. 

Later that afternoon, chastened by your wise disproof of their absolute claim about swans, the Viceroy proposes a new law of nature based on their lagoon observations:

> Ducks can be green.

{% capture summary %}
Again, think fast! Should you be CRITICAL or AGREEABLE?
{% endcapture %}
{% capture details %}
> Be AGREEABLE!
{% endcapture %}
{% include details.html %}

Perhaps you thought this time the Viceroy was trying to make a fool out of you, to see if you'd agree to a ridiculous claim. You've seen brown ducks, but green ones?? Being CRITICAL worked well last time. Why not try again?

You should not be CRITICAL because, in this case, the Viceroy has taken a secure position.

Consider: what would it take to prove the Viceroy wrong?

You couldn't just find those brown ducks you saw before. Just because a duck CAN BE brown doesn't mean it CAN'T BE green. This time, being CRITICAL will require finding all the ducks and making sure they aren't green.

So here, it will be wiser to be AGREEABLE. Go over to the lagoon and check. As soon as you find one green duck, you can safely confirm that the Viceroy is correct.

So what's the difference between these two theories?

When the Viceroy says something MUST BE the case, it's easier to be CRITICAL.

When the Viceroy says something COULD BE the case, it's easier to be AGREEABLE.
