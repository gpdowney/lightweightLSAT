A Hypothetical is a valid arrangement of all the Elements on the Board.

If you can make and use Hypos smoothly, you can play any Game quickly with 100% accuracy.

If making Hypos feels uncomfortable, stick with it. Making Hypos is a muscle you need to stretch and grow. That muscle might be very underdeveloped if you've only practiced Wizarding.

Struggling might also be a sign that you aren't using your Hypos correctly.

Below you'll find some tips on how to make Hypos more smoothly...

## Overlap

The key to making Hypos smoothly is to follow the Overlapping Rules as you add information.

### An Example

Suppose you were playing an [Standard Order][4] Game with 5 elements: A B C D E. 

And you were doing this Q:

> If A is in 3, what could be true?

{% capture summary %}
What's the first thing you do?
{% endcapture %}

{% capture details %}
Make a new Number Line and put A in 3, because this is [an easy IF Q](points.html#easy-if).

> _ _ A _ _
{% endcapture %}
{% include details.html %}

Now, suppose this Game had two Rules.

1. B must be next to C
2. A goes before D

{% capture summary %}
You need to follow all the Rules, but which Rule would be better to follow first?
{% endcapture %}

{% capture details %}
You'd be better off if you followed Rule 2. 

Rule 2 Overlaps with A, and you have A on the Board. 

So you can add D in a cloud after A:

> _ _ A ( _ D )
{% endcapture %}
{% include details.html %}

{% capture summary %}
What's next?
{% endcapture %}

{% capture details %}
Now you can follow Rule 1.

There's not enough space for (BC) after A, so they must go before, also in a cloud since they could go in either order.

> ( B C ) A ( _ D )
{% endcapture %}
{% include details.html %}

{% capture summary %}
Now you've Taken Care Of all the Rules. What could you do next?
{% endcapture %}

{% capture details %}
Ask yourself: Who's Left?

You've taken care of A B C and D. So E is the only Leftover. There's only room after A, in the cloud with D. So you can add it there.

> ( B C ) A ( E D )
{% endcapture %}
{% include details.html %}

Now you've got every Element on the Board, and you Took Care Of all the Rules. You have a Hypo! And a very flexible one at that.

### Some Takeaways

1. Take it one Rule at a time. You don't need to make leaps. Be smooth and steady and Robotic.
1. Don't randomly follow Rules. Follow the Rule that *Overlaps* with the Elements you've already added to the Board.
1. Don't make assumptions. Don't put an Element somewhere just because it *could* go there. Use clouds to add what you know without committing to one possibility.
1. Notice what Rules are Taken Care Of. If you completely followed a Rule or it can't be broken, then you don't need to worry about that Rule for the rest of that Hypo.
1. When you're out of Rules, ask: Who's Left?

It isn't necessary to memorize the rules, because you've written them down. But the more you play a Game, the more fluent you'll become in how it works. It will be easier to make Hypos as you go.

## Don't make Hypos in your head.

Always write down your Hypos. If you try to keep track of all the variables in your mind, you'll get jumbled. And, worst of all, you won't be able to use that Hypo on future Qs.

## Use Past Hypos

The Hypos you make can be used on other Qs.

### To return to our example from above, suppose this same game had another Q:

> Which of the following must be true?

And here's the Answers:

> (A) A is before E
>
> (B) A is not last.
>
> (C) B is before C
>
> (D) C is not first
>
> (E) D is before E

And here's the Hypo from the previous Q:

> ( B C ) A ( E D )

You can use this one Hypo to disprove 3 of the Answers for free.

{% capture summary %}
(A) A is before E
{% endcapture %}
{% capture details %}
You don't know about (A).

In the Hypo, A is before E. Whether that must always be true, you don't know. 

So based on this Hypo alone, you should Defer on (A).
{% endcapture %}
{% include details.html %}

{% capture summary %}
(B) A is not last.
{% endcapture %}
{% capture details %}
You don't know about (B) either.

In the Hypo, A is not last. This could be true. Whether it must always be true, you can't tell from the Hypo.

So based on this Hypo alone, you should Defer on (B) also. But don't be discouraged.
{% endcapture %}
{% include details.html %}

{% capture summary %}
(C) B is before C
{% endcapture %}
{% capture details %}
You know (C) is wrong.

In the Hypo, B could be before C. But they're in a cloud. So B could also be after C.

So you've proved that (C) could be false, which means you can eliminate it.
{% endcapture %}
{% include details.html %}

{% capture summary %}
(D) C is not first
{% endcapture %}
{% capture details %}
You can also eliminate (D).

In the Hypo, C can go first.
{% endcapture %}
{% include details.html %}

{% capture summary %}
(E) D is before E
{% endcapture %}
{% capture details %}

In the Hypo, D can come after E.

So you can eliminate (E), because it's not always true.
{% endcapture %}
{% include details.html %}

### What's left to do now?

At this point, you can allow yourself a quick second to try to Wizard the Answer. That is: you can stare at the Rules and the remaining Answers. Because you've narrowed down the options, there's less to think about and it might be clearer to you which is correct or incorrect.

Remember the Rules were: 

1. A -- D 
2. (BC)

If you select an Answer based on Wizardry, you better be 100% confident. And it better only take 10 seconds. If you aren't 100% or it takes more than 10 seconds, then make a new Hypo.

Since this is a Must be True Q, you want your new Hypo to disprove the Answer you think is Wrong. If you aren't sure which one is wrong, then start at the top.

Lets start with (A): "A is before E."

{% capture summary %}
What would it take to disprove (A) 
{% endcapture %}
{% capture details %}
To disprove (A) I want to show that A doesn't need to go before E. In other words, I want to put A after E.

On Test Day, I would say all this to myself in my head, quickly. I want to be sure of what I'm trying to do and why I'm trying to do it before I start making my Hypo.
{% endcapture %}
{% include details.html %}

{% capture summary %}
Where would you start the Hypo to disprove (A)?
{% endcapture %}
{% capture details %}
Trick Q: unlike the last Hypo, there's no place you *must* start. 
{% endcapture %}
{% include details.html %}

You could easily get hung up here. To keep moving: know your options.

*Option 1:* Dive in. Put E somewhere before A. And remember that you started from a random place. If it breaks, consider making a new Hypo with a different starting point OR go on to the next Answer.

*Option 2:* Make a smart first move. A smart first move increases the chance that you'll be able to follow all the Rules and make a valid Hypo.

Try either, see if it works out. Then maybe try again, see what a different starting point leads to.

{% capture summary %}
Here's how I'd do it:
{% endcapture %}
{% capture details %}

I'd put E at the very beginning. That way I know that A will come after, which means if everything works out, my new Hypo will disprove (A). 

Putting E at the beginning also makes space for (BC). And it's far left, so A will probably be able to go before D.

> E _ _ _ _

And then A right after to leave space:

> E A _ _ _

The Overlapping rule is "A -- D", but that's taken care of because there's no way to break it here.

So the next rule is "(BC)", that could be broken. 

Now I could put (BC) in a cloud inside a cloud. This gives me a flexible Hypo:

> E A ( (BC) _ )

Or I could just randomly put (BC) together, because I only need this Hypo to work once to disprove A. This gives me a stable Hypo:

> E A C B _

And then, in either case, D is my Leftover.

flexible:

> E A ( (BC), D )

or stable:

> E A C B D

I tend to prefer flexible Hypos, but you might prefer the concreteness and readability of a stable example.
{% endcapture %}
{% include details.html %}

{% capture summary %}
So what have we just accomplished with this new Hypo?
{% endcapture %}
{% capture details %}
Since the Hypo worked, we disproved (A). That means we can safely select (B), the only remaining Answer, and Move On.
{% endcapture %}
{% include details.html %}

{% capture summary %}
Now, you might be wondering: why was it OK for us to start at a random place while testing (A), but not for the IF question above?
{% endcapture %}
{% capture details %}
On the IF question, we weren't testing an Answer. If we started doing things randomly, we'd only end up with one possible way things could go after A was in 3. That might luckily point us to the right Answer, but it might not.

When we're making a Hypo to test an Answer, we can more safely make arbitrary moves because we only need one Hypo to work to prove or disprove that Answer.
{% endcapture %}
{% include details.html %}

### More Takeaways

1. Use your Hypos on future Qs. You might be able to get free points, or at least free eliminations.
1. Know what you want to do before you start doing it. Could, false, must, true, it can all get a little bewildering. Ground yourself before you start making a Hypo. Similarly, when you look to your Hypos to prove or disprove an Answer, know what you're looking for before you look.
1. Keep moving. When you get stuck, just start making Hypos. Use them to think through the problem on paper.

### Be careful about revising Hypos

You might be tempted to quickly switch two Elements in your Hypo to make it useful on a future Q.

This switching is dangerous. When you make the switch, you might accidentally break a rule.

So if you do revise your Hypos, quickly check all the rules to make sure you didn't break anything.

### Practice Ideas

- Play a Game where you make as many Hypos as possible: prove and disprove every Answer two different ways.
- Play a Game where you try make as few Hypos as possible, meaning get maximal use out of each Hypo you make.
- Put "Overlap" on a sticky note while you make Hypos.
- Put "Who's Left" on a sticky note while you make Hypos.
- Play a Game without any Set-Up, just read the Scenario and Conditions and make Hypos.
