## Anatomy of a Logic Game

[![example of a logic game][1]][1]

## You only need to do 2 tasks on Logic Games

1. [Visualize the Game][2]
2. [Get Points][3]

## Think on paper

When you put everything you know on paper, you're less likely to make mistakes and more able to make connections.

## Learn how to play the game by playing it

You do not need to completely solve the Game before you play it.

Practice comfort with discomfort.

## Memorize the common patterns

Know the 2 game families, 7 game species, and many common rules.

Know how to automatically recognize them and how to quickly draw them.

Don't be Cowboy without a system, dependent only on your intuitions, reinventing the wheel every time.

## Slow is smooth. Smooth is fast

Be a Robot. Robots are mechanical and consistent.

You don't need to be a Wizard. Wizards depend on unreliable magic. If the magic happens, go with it, but don't depend on it.
