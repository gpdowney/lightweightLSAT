## What Are Games?

[![example of a flexi group game][1]][1]

Each game involves a strange *situation*.

This situation is made up of a number of moving parts called the **elements**.

The elements are governed by a set of **rules**, which constrain where the elements can and can't go.

Generally, the elements will be either...

1. **ordered** along a number line or
2. **grouped** together into a few buckets. 

## Drawing The Game

You first step, in playing any game, is to draw it.

Depending on the game's type, the buckets or the number line serve as the **board**.

![example of a order game drawing][2]

In addition to the board, you can draw an **index** to track the elements.

You'll also want to find some way to visualize all of the *rules*, so that you don't need to re-read them as you play the game.

> Drawing is important because it allows you to put everything you know about the game on paper, which frees up your brain to think about how it all fits together.

As a bonus, you might notice **connections** between the rules. But be careful, looking for connections can lead to staring and staring is the time-killer.

## Answer The Questions By Proving And Disproving Answers

Unfortunately, you can't get points for showing your work on the LSAT. 

The only way to get points is to correctly answer the questions.

The most reliable and efficient way to evaluate the answers is to make hypos, aka **hypos**.

A hypo is like an example, it's one possible arrangement of all the elements.

A *valid* hypo **takes care of all the rules**, which means none of the rules could be broken.

Valid hypos are powerful and limited tools. How you can use them depends on whether the question is asking whether the answers "could be" or "must be."

Question | You can use hypos to...
-- | --
**Could be** | *select* the 1 correct answer
**Must be** | *eliminate* the 4 wrong answers

By default, most people do not use hypos properly.

If you think you aren't most people, [try this quiz from the New York Times][nyt].

Otherwise, [this story about swans might help][swan].

## Timing

When you're first learning about games, don't worry about time. Test day time limits will create too much pressure when you're first learning.

If anything, use a count-up timer to get objective information about where you spend your time.

[Learn more about using a count-up timer here][countup].

On test day, aim to finish the easier two games in under 15:00 total, so you have 10:00 each for the harder two.

Alternatively, skip one game, so that you can perfectly complete the other three.

## How The Lightweight Lsat Approach To Games Is Different

Because the Games section is relatively knowledge intensive, knowledge-based guides are actually helpful for learning games. 

> It is telling that there's been an arms race between the LSAT and test prep companies in the Games section, with games getting weirder and harder, while the Reading and Reasoning sections have stayed largely the same.

These other guides usually teach you how to be a games **Wizard**. That is, they teach you how to solve games before you get to the questions.

In contrast, the Lightweight LSAT teaches you how to be a **Robot**. That is, how to solve games by making hypos. The upside of being a Robot is that you can learn how any game works by playing it.

There are pros and cons to each approach, which are [outlined at greater length here][wiz].
