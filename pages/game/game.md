## Anatomy of a Logic Game

[![example of a logic Game][1]][1]

## You only need to do 2 tasks on Logic Games

1. [Visualize the Game][2]
2. [Get Points][3]

## Think on paper

When you put everything you know on paper, you're less likely to make mistakes and more able to make connections.

Staring is the time killer. 

If you keep your pencil moving, you'll think more quickly and more clearly.

## Learn how to play the Game by playing it

You do not need to completely solve every Game before you play it.

It will feel uncomfortable, at first, to learn how Games work by playing them. But stay with this discomfort. Practice comfort with discomfort.

If playing Games without solving them feels *impossibly* hard, make sure you're doing the Qs in [the right order][3] in order to generate valid HYPOs at the beginning. And make sure you know how to [use HYPOs][4] to prove or disprove Answers.

If you rely on solving every Game, then you will be fragile. If the Test throws a weird or novel Game at you on Test Day, you'll be hosed. But if you can play any Game, even with a minimal Set-Up, you can adapt to anything. 

And if you don't need a detailed Set-Up, you can get into the Qs more quickly, which is where the points are. There's no points for showing your work on the LSAT. And time is very precious.

## Memorize the common patterns

Know the 2 Game [families][5], 8 Game [species][5], and the many [common rules][6].

Know how to automatically recognize them and how to quickly draw them.

Don't be Cowboy without a system, dependent only on your intuitions, reinventing the wheel every time.

## Slow is smooth. Smooth is fast

Be a Robot. Robots are mechanical and consistent.

You don't need to be a Wizard. Wizards depend on unreliable magic. If the magic happens, go with it, but don't depend on it.
