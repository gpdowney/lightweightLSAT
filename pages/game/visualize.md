## Anatomy of Set-Up

![example of a logic game set-up][1]

## There are 3 steps to Set-Up:

1. Scan
1. Draw
1. Check

## Scan

In the Scan, glance at everything on the first page of the Game. That includes the Scenario, the Conditions, and the 1st Q.

It's a Scan, not a deep read.

It's useful to have a Checklist for your Scan. Here's my Scan checklist:

1. Is the Game more Ordered or Grouped? Or does it include some of both?
2. Is it a common [Species][2] of Game?
3. What are the [Variables][3] and [Numbers][4]?
4. Is there anything novel or weird?

## Draw

In the Draw, you put your pencil on your paper. You need to visualize everything the Test gives you (and nothing else).

Your Drawing should be complete and accurate and neat. It does not need to be perfectly elegant or look the same as anyone else's. 

Draw in a way that *makes visual sense to you*. 

Generally, visual sense means:

- Draw Rules like they'll look on Board. 
- Draw a Board that makes it easy to write the Rules.
- Put the Rules on the Board whenever possible. (You can put Rules on the Board and on the side. Redundancy is OK.)
- Skip formalities. Everything you Draw should create visual value for you.

Memorize how to Draw the [common Rules][5] and [standard Boards][6]. Don't waste your brainpower figuring it out each time.

When you run into a Game or a Rule you don't immediately know how to Draw:

- Hack it. Just get something on paper, even if your drawing is inelegant. (Good for Race Practice.)
- Experiment! Figure it out for yourself. (Good during Puzzle Practice.)
- Consult the list of common Rules. (Good during Skill Practice.)
- Make a Flashcard based on what makes sense to you. (Good during Review.)

## Check

In the Check, you take a second to make sure you got everything correctly.

1. Breathe.
1. Quickly re-read the Scenario to make sure your Drawing is correct.
1. Check for Elements without Rules (aka [Leftovers][7])
1. Optional: Check for [Splits][8] and [Connections](#connections).

*(Beware: Looking for Splits and Connections can easily become a time-suck.)*

## Principles of Set-Up

You'll know that your Set-Up was good enough when you don't need to re-read the Scenario as you play the Game.

Make Set-Up efficient so you can get to the Qs, where the points are.

Don't rush or linger. Re-read to get everything down accurately. See what you see, and move on.

Experiment with doing less Set-Up to save time. See what you need in your Set-Up and what you don't.

### Don't Worry too much about Connections {#connections}

Connections happen when two rules can be combined into one. Or when a rule has secret implications.

For example, these two rules are Connectable:

> A is next to B == (AB)
> 
> B is before C == B -- C

We could write them as one rule:

> (AB) -- C

And then we also know:

> C can't go first or second
> 
> A and B can't go last

Connections often happen when...
- the same Element appears in multiple Rules, or
- when Elements are limited in where they can go.

You might see Connections between Rules during your Scan or Check. And you might make Connections as you Draw. But don't let looking for Connections slow you down or compromise your Set-Up's completeness and accuracy.

Often, the best way to see Connections is to start playing the Game. 

When you miss a Connection that feels obvious later, make a Flashcard to help yourself recognize something similar next time.
