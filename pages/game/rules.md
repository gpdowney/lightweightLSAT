## Sense + Value

Try to draw rules in a way that *makes visual sense* to **you** and *creates visual value* for **you**.

Generally, "visual sense" means:

- Draw rules like they'll look on board. 
- Draw a board that makes it easy to write the rules.
- Put the rules and elements into the board whenever possible.

"Visual value" could mean:

- Skip formalities... maybe you don't need an index.
- Redundancy is OK... write rules both on the board and on the side.
- Be neat so you can read your work.

## Weird Rules

As often as the common game rules repeat, every game is unique. So drawing is about flexibility as much as it's about memorization.

Type of Practice | How to approach to weird rules
-- | --
Skill | Use the tools you have as best you can. Think about what it's most similar to and start your drawing there.
Puzzle | Experiment! Try many different ways of drawing it. See what works for you.
Race | Hack it. It doesn't need to be elegant, just get it on paper.

After reviewing weird stuff, make a flashcard based on what made the most sense to you.

## Placements

R is in 1.

### Option-Placement

M is in 2 or 5.

O or P is in 4.

### Anti-Placement

S is not in 3.

![Placement Drawing][1]

### Equality

Spot 1 and 4 are the same.

### Anti-Equality

Spot 2 and 5 are not the same.

![Equality Drawing][2]

## Relatives

A is earlier than B.

### Link

A is later than C and D.

B is not later than E and not earlier than F.

![Relative Drawing][16]

### Chip

G is earlier than H or later than I, but not both.

![Chip Drawing][3]

### Sammie

J is earlier than K or earlier than L, but not both.

![Sammie Drawing][4]

## Clouds

M is next to N.

### Block

O is immediately after P.

### Anti-Cloud

Q and R cannot occupy consecutive spaces.

### Spaced-Cloud

S and T are separated by exactly 1 space.

![Clouds Drawing][5]

## Variables

T is a zebra.

### Variable-Option

P is a zebra or a walrus.

### Anti-Variable

U is not a yak.

### Variable-Placement

A yak must be in 2.

![Variables Drawing][6]

## Conditionals

If O is not in 3, then P is in 4.

When E is included, it is before G.

![Conditionals Drawing][7]

### Bi-Conditional

If A is not a Zebra then B must be a Yak. If B is a Yak then A is not a Zebra.

A is not a Zebra if and only if B is a Yak.

![Bi-Conditionals Drawing][8]

### Chain

If C is a Walrus, then D must be a Yak. If D is a Yak then, E must be a Zebra.

![Chain Drawing][9]

## Stacks

O and N go together.

### Option-Stack

V is with T or U.

### Conditional-Stack

If R is in a group, then S must be also.

![Stacks Drawing][10]

### Push-Out (aka Anti-Stack)

If O is in a group, then M cannot be in that group.

O and M cannot both be included.

### Push-In

If P is not in a group, then Q must be.

At least one of P or Q, or both, must be included.

![Push Drawing][11]

### Fixed-Stack

V is accompanied by one other element.

### Flexi-Stack

W is accompanied by at least one other element.

![More Stack Drawing][12]

## Numbers

### Exact

L appears exactly twice.

The are 4 presentations: half by Zebras, one by Walruses, and the rest by Yaks.

![Exact Numeric Drawing][13]

### Min

N must be included.

R and S appear together at least twice.

### Max

T cannot repeat.

M cannot go more than twice.

![Min and Max Numeric Drawing][14]

### MinMax

A, B, and C must each be included at least once and not more than 3 times.

### More

There must be more Zebras than Walruses.

### Less

There are fewer Walruses than Yaks.

### Same

There are an equal number of Zebras and Yaks.
