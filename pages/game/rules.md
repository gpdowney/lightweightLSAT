title: How to Draw the Common Rules

You could make many Flashcards from this page.

And there are many fine ways to Draw Rules. As always, experiment to figure out what works for you.

In general, useful Rules visually match your board. For example, don't copy my vertical Stack if you draw Group games horizontally.

If you encounter a weird or unique rule...

- adapt or combine common Drawings,
- use a Split to take care of it upfront, or
- Draw it as best you can and Move On.

## Placements

R is in 1.

### Option-Placement

M is in 2 or 5.

O or P is in 4.

### Anti-Placement

S is not in 3.

![Placement Drawing][1]

### Equality

Spot 1 and 4 are the same.

### Anti-Equality

Spot 2 and 5 are not the same.

![Equality Drawing][2]

## Relatives

A is earlier than B.

### Link

A is later than C and D.

B is not later than E and not earlier than F.

![Relative Drawing][16]

### Chip

G is earlier than H or later than I, but not both.

![Chip Drawing][3]

### Sammie

J is earlier than K or earlier than L, but not both.

![Sammie Drawing][4]

## Clouds

M is next to N.

### Block

O is immediately after P.

### Anti-Cloud

Q and R cannot occupy consecutive spaces.

### Spaced-Cloud

S and T are separated by exactly 1 space.

![Clouds Drawing][5]

## Variables

T is a zebra.

### Variable-Option

P is a zebra or a walrus.

### Anti-Variable

U is not a yak.

### Variable-Placement

A yak must be in 2.

![Variables Drawing][6]

## Conditionals

If O is not in 3, then P is in 4.

When E is included, it is before G.

![Conditionals Drawing][7]

### Bi-Conditional

If A is not a Zebra then B must be a Yak. If B is a Yak then A is not a Zebra.

A is not a Zebra if and only if B is a Yak.

![Bi-Conditionals Drawing][8]

### Chain

If C is a Walrus, then D must be a Yak. If D is a Yak then, E must be a Zebra.

![Chain Drawing][9]

## Stacks

O and N go together.

### Option-Stack

V is with T or U.

### Conditional-Stack

If R is in a group, then S must be also.

![Stacks Drawing][10]

### Push-Out (aka Anti-Stack)

If O is in a group, then M cannot be in that group.

O and M cannot both be included.

### Push-In

If P is not in a group, then Q must be.

At least one of P or Q, or both, must be included.

![Push Drawing][11]

### Fixed-Stack

V is accompanied by one other element.

### Flexi-Stack

W is accompanied by at least one other element.

![More Stack Drawing][12]

## Numeric

### Exact

L appears exactly twice.

The are 4 presentations: half by Zebras, one by Walruses, and the rest by Yaks.

![Exact Numeric Drawing][13]

### Min

N must be included.

R and S appear together at least twice.

### Max

T cannot repeat.

M cannot go more than twice.

![Min and Max Numeric Drawing][14]

### MinMax

A, B, and C must each be included at least once and more more than 3 times.

### More

There must be more Zebras than Walruses.

### Less

There are fewer Walruses than Yaks.

### Same

There are an equal number of Zebras and Yaks.
