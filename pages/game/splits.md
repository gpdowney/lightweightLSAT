## Splits are when a Game can only go a few ways.

Splits must be **exhaustive**. Splits map out *every* possibility.

(Beware: A [hypo][hypo] is when you draw out some of the possibilities.)

[Options][option] often create Splits:

For example, the Rule 

>"A must go in 2 or 4" 

gives a 2-way Split:

> "A in 2." vs. "A in 4."

And so do [Bi-Conditionals][bic]:

For example, in a Binary Game, the Rule: 

> "Either X or Y must be included, but not both" 

also gives a 2-way Split:

> "X in + Y out." vs. "X out + Y in."

### Tip: Map all of the Splits before you add-in other Rules or Elements.

Make sure you've outlined all of the possibilities before you start filling in each Split.

## A Split is a time investment.

Splits tend to be worthwhile when...

- There are other Rules connected to the Split.
- The Split takes care of a tricky Rule.
- The Game is hard.
- It is only a 2-way or 3-way Split.

## Puzzle Practice Idea: Split every Game.

Even if it seems like a 8-way Split.

And try Splitting each Game many different ways.

When you're done, record what makes Splits worthwhile (or not) and the specific clues that suggest a Split.
