## Splits Happen When A Game Can Only Go A Few Ways

For example, an option rule, like

>"A must go in 2 or 4" 

gives a 2-way split:

> 1. _ A _ _
>
> 2. _ _ _ A

## Splits Are Exhaustive 

> This means splits are different than hypos. Hypos only represent *some* of the possibilities.

Splits map out *every* possibility.

Create new boards with each possibility before you add-in other rules or elements.

This will help make sure your splits are exhaustive and you don't forget where they started.

## Splits Are Time Investments

Splits tend to be worthwhile when it's only a 2-way or 3-way split and...

- There are other rules connected to the split, or
- the split takes care of a tricky rule, or
- the game is hard.

For example, biconditional rules can be intimidating, but they nearly always create useful splits:

> "Either X or Y must be included, but not both" 

gives a 2-way split:

> 1. Yes X / No Y
>
> 2. Yes Y / No X

Puzzle practice idea: Split Every Game
{% endcapture %}
{% capture details %}
In puzzle mode, try to find multiple ways to split every game you see. Maybe even if it seems like an unproductive 8-way split.

Learning what splits aren't helpful is the best way to learn how to identify helpful splits.

When you're done, record what makes splits worthwhile and the specific clues that suggest a split.

## When To Split

If you notice a promising split during your scan, then you can use the split to make your drawing more efficient. If the split takes care of one or more rules, you don't need to draw those rules.

If you notice splits later, you can still rework your drawing around the split.

And some questions create mini-splits, particularly hard IF questions.
