Disprove MUST BE Answers. MUST BE is hard to prove. 

Prove COULD BE Answers. COULD BE is easy to prove. 

**This approach is not intuitive for most humans. You *must* practice this [deliberately][skill].**

![diagram](assets/images/couldmust.png)

Always try to make HYPOS that COULD BE.

On a MUST BE Q, you want to test the 4 Wrong answers in order to disprove them.

On a COULD BE Q, you want to test the 1 Correct answer in order to prove it.

Ironically, that can make COULD BE Qs more challenging.

And MUST BE Qs generate more useful HYPOS for the future.
