Wizards can understand how a game works by looking hard at it. Then they look at the questions and instantly know all the answers.

Robots learn how games work by playing them. They rely on hypos, rather than insight, to definitively (dis)prove answers.

Most guides to the LSAT (including this one) are written by Wizards. And most guides to the Games section (*not* including this one) rely on Wizardry.

## Wizards Are Fragile

To understand the problem with Wizards, this framework [via Nassim Nicholas Taleb][taleb] might be useful:

Fragile | Robust | Anti-Fragile
-- | -- | --
vulnerable to disorder | resistant to disorder | benefits from disorder

The main problem is that wizards are *fragile*. Their magic depends on completely understanding how games work. Which means that the Wizard's magic fails when it's most needed, on hard games. 

When Wizards fail, they fail catastrophically. A single weird rule ruins the whole game, a single surprising game ruins the whole test.

At best, Wizards can become *robust* Wizard-Knights. 

> Knights try to make armor out of knowledge about the test. But their armor is heavy and ineffective.

To be fair, the Games section is where knowledge is most useful. So knowledge-based guides are more useful for the Games section. In fact, recently, the LSAC has tried to negate this advantage by making the Games section increasingly weird.

That's actually good news for Robots, because Robots are *anti-fragile*. The Robot's method works on every game, no matter how weird. While Wizards stare at games they can't solve, Robots get busy making hypos to (dis)prove answers.

## Pros & Cons

| | Pros | Cons
-- | -- | --
Wizardry | may be able to immediately answer many / all questions <br><br> connecting rules reduces the number of rules to keep track of / follow | risks getting stumped by hard games / questions <br><br> must invest lots of time upfront <br><br> must juggle variables in head <br><br> can't reuse work <br><br> more vulnerable to small mistakes <br><br> wastes time staring <br><br> failure is devastating to timing and emotions
Robotics | can learn about the game by playing at it <br><br> saves minutes on set-up <br><br> provides tools for every game, even the weirdest and hardest <br><br> saves brain power by thinking on paper <br><br> can reuse hypos from one question on another <br><br> prevents silly mistakes <br><br> failures is useful information | may be hard to follow the rules if you don't understand how they work together <br><br> may need to create many hypos to get a single answer <br><br> drawing takes time <br><br> feels unnatural to think properly about how to approach *could be* vs. *must be*

## Robot-Wizards

To be fair, you can be both. Going to either extreme would be a mistake. 

When you're being a Robot, don't get stuck in the slog of making hypos. Build moments for inspiration into your practice, like:

- Take a second to breathe and see the big picture during your scan *or* check.
- On WHICH questions, give yourself a chance to Wizard *after* you've reused old hypos to limit the options.
- In review, analyze your work to identify the deeper patterns that drove that game.

If you insist on being a Wizard. Take time to practice being a Robot too:

- If making hypos is always your plan B, you won't learn how to do it efficiently for when you do need it.
- Trying to play that "impossible" game like a Robot will help you understand it more deeply than any expert explanation.
- And being a Robot might improve the rigor of your thought to make you a better Wizard.
