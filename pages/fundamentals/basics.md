## The LSAT consists of 3 graded sections

1. Logic Games (LG).
2. Reading Comprehension (RC), and
3. Logical Reasoning (LR)

When you take the LSAT, these sections may appear in any order.

## And there will be a 4th, ungraded section

This "experimental section" can be any of the 3 (LR, RC, or LG).

You will not know which one is ungraded.

(And don't bother trying. Trying will just psych you out.)

## Don't worry too much about your score

Especially when you're new.

That said, [here's how to make sense of your score][1].

## You have 35:00 to complete each section

For LG and RC, you have an average of 8:30 per game/passage.

For LR, you have an average of 1:20 per question.

Do not always aim for the average. [More on timing here][2]

Test Day looks like this: 35:00 section, 1:00 pause, 35:00 section, 10:00 break, 35:00 section, 1:00 pause, 35:00 section.

If you finish early, you can review flagged Qs or rest. You can't go ahead or use the extra time on the next section.

If you qualify for [an accommodation][3] you may receive more time per section.

## You will take the test digitally

And, at least until July, 2022, from home.

The interface is exactly the same as LawHub.

There are many security-theater-type requirements like: what can be in the room, special software you need to install, the size of your earbuds, your camera angle, how many pieces of paper you can have, etc..

[Know the rules][4] to protect yourself and to prevent disruptions.

You'll have to be on camera the whole time. You won't be able to see the proctor.

The proctors are unreliable. Report problems with proctors or the test experience to the [LSAC directly][5].

## The LSAT Writing

Separately from the test, you'll need to write a short essay in 35 minutes.

It appears to have 0 effect on admissions decisions. (If you are an admissions officer, please let me know if I'm wrong about this.)

Write a normal 5 paragraph essay:

1. Tell them what you'll tell them.
2. Tell them.
3. Then, tell them what you told them.

Practice once or twice before you do it for real.

Otherwise, don't worry about it much.

If you're still concerned, [here's more about the writing sample][6].
