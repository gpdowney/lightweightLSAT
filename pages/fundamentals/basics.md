## The Lsat Consists Of 3 Graded Sections

1. Games
2. Reading
3. Reasoning

When you take the LSAT, these sections may appear in any order.

### And There Will Be A 4th, Ungraded Section

This ungraded "experimental section" could be Games, Reading, or Reasoning.

You will not know which one is ungraded.

(And don't bother trying to figure out which is which. Trying will just psych you out.)

## You Have 35:00 To Complete Each Section

For Games and Reading, this gives you an average of **8:30** for each of the 4 games/texts.

For Reasoning, this gives you an average of **1:20** per question.

Do not always aim for the average.

### Breaks

You get a 1 minute pause to read instructions between each section. And a 10 minute break in the middle.

In other words, your test day looks like this: 35:00 section, 1:00 pause, 35:00 section, 10:00 break, 35:00 section, 1:00 pause, 35:00 section.

If you finish a section early, you can review flagged questions or rest. You can't go ahead or use the extra time on the next section.

If you qualify for an accommodation you may receive more time per section.

## You Will Take The Test Digitally And At Home

The interface is exactly the same as LawHub. On Lawhub the LSAC offers several free practice tests you can try out. Use these to get a baseline score and try out the interface.

[You can access LawHub here.][1]

For test day, there are many security-theater-type-requirements like: what can be in the room, special software you need to install, the size of your earbuds, your camera angle, how many pieces of paper you can have, etc.. 

To protect yourself and prevent disruptions, [read the official list of rules on the LSAC's site][4].

You'll have to be on camera the whole time. You won't be able to see the proctor.

The proctors are unreliable. [Go directly to the LSAC's site to report problems with proctors or the test experience][5].

## Score

The LSAT is graded on a curve.

## The LSAT Writing

Separately, you'll need to write a short essay in 35 minutes. I recommend doing this Writing section about 3 days after your test day.

The Writing section appears to have 0 effect on admissions decisions. (If you are an admissions officer, please let me know if I'm wrong about this.)

Write a normal 5 paragraph essay:

1. Tell them what you'll tell them.
2. Tell them.
3. Then, tell them what you told them.

Practice once or twice before you do it for real. Otherwise, don't worry about it much.
