## The LSAT Consists Of 3 Graded Sections

1. Games
2. Reading
3. Reasoning

When you take the LSAT, these sections may appear in any order.

### And There Will Be An Ungraded 4th Section

This "experimental section" could be a Games, Reading, or Reasoning section.

You will not know which one is ungraded.

(And don't bother trying to figure out which is which on test day. Trying will just psych you out.)

## You Have 35:00 To Complete Each Section

For Games and Reading, this gives you an average of **8:30** for each of the 4 games/texts.

For Reasoning, this gives you an average of **1:20** per question.

Do not always aim for the average. 

[Read (lots) more about timing here.][2]

### Breaks

You get a 1:00 pause to read instructions between each section. And a 10:00 break in the middle, between sections 2 and 3.

In other words, your test day looks like this: 35:00 section, 1:00 pause, 35:00 section, 10:00 break, 35:00 section, 1:00 pause, 35:00 section.

If you finish a section early, you can review flagged questions within that section or rest. You can't go back to the last section or ahead to the next section.

If you qualify for an accommodation you may receive more time per section.

## You Will Take The Test Digitally And At Home

On test day, the interface will be almost exactly the same as LawHub. This is one reason you should practice on LawHub.

The LSAC offers several free practice tests on LawHub you can try out. You can use these to get a baseline score and try out the interface. [You can access LawHub here.][1] 

If you can't afford to pay $100 for LawHub, [you can request free access from the LSAC here][waiver].

For test day, there will be many security-theater-type-requirements like what can be in the room, special software you need to install, the size of your earbuds, your camera angle, how many pieces of paper you can have, etc... To protect yourself and prevent disruptions, [read the official list of rules on the LSAC's site][4].

There will be a proctor watching you the entire time with the power to control your computer. The proctors are unreliable; they often make mistakes. [Report problems with proctors or the test experience to the LSAC directly][5].

## Score

The LSAT is graded on a curve.

That means your score consists of both a "raw" score, which is the total number of questions you got right. As well as a scaled score, which indicates how many people you did better than. 

Your scaled score can range from 120 to 180. 

- A 120 means that you did *worse than* 99.9% of test takers.
- A 150 means you did better than 50% of test takers and worse than 50%.
- A 180 means you did *better than* 99.9% of test takers.

## The LSAT Writing

Separately, you'll need to write a short essay in 35 minutes. I recommend doing this Writing section about 3 days after your test day.

The Writing section appears to have 0 effect on admissions decisions. (If you are an admissions officer, please let me know if I'm wrong about this.)

Write a normal 5 paragraph essay:

1. Tell them what you'll tell them.
2. Tell them.
3. Then, tell them what you told them.

Practice once or twice before you do it for real. Otherwise, don't worry about it much.
