title: The 3 Types Of Practice--Skill, Puzzle, And Race.

There are three effective ways to study for the LSAT:

1. Skill practice
2. Puzzle practice
3. Race practice

Skill practice is intentional and iterative. 

- Intentional means that you decide, before you look at the question, what skill you want to work on. You choose questions based on what will help you practice that skill.
- Iterative means that you learn from your experience on the last question to adapt your approach to the next question.

Puzzle practice is unhurried and curious.

- Unhurried doesn't mean slow or plodding, but rather you take time to deeply understand the question.
- Curious means that you leave expectations behind and allow the question to show you what matters.

Race practice is timed and limited.

- Timed doesn't mean rushed. It can involve a count-up timer, or a count-down timer.
- Limited means that you pick a certain number of questions or a certain amount of time, and stop when you reach that limit.

More on how to do each below...

## Skill Practice

Here are the steps of skill practice:

1. Set an intention: Pick 1 skill you want to work on.
1. Try it: Attempt to apply the skill on a real LSAT question.
1. Reflect: Did you do it? Was it appropriate? Was it useful? 
1. Revise your intention: Update your intention based on your experience applying it.
1. Repeat.

For example, if I were working on the Reasoning section, I might...

1. Resolve to make *predictions*.
1. Then try an easy question.
1. Maybe I get it right. But I didn't pause to make a prediction, I just rushed right to the answers. Drat!
1. I revise my intention. This time I'll write my prediction down before looking at the answer.
1. I try again on another question.
1. Maybe I get it wrong, but I did write a prediction. That's an improvement. And on second glance, the right answer was pretty close to my prediction.
1. I revise my intention, again. This time I'll compare each answer to my written prediction.

And so on...

As your skill improves, you can attempt multiple questions at one go, or try harder questions. As your habits improve, you might find that some parts of the practice, like writing down your intentions, are no longer necessary. And eventually the skill should become so automatic that you don't need to practice it intentionally and can shift into race practice.

If you run into persistent difficulty, you might need to work on a different skill. For example, making predictions in Reasoning depends on understanding the argument. So if you're struggling to predict, you might need to work instead on understanding.

Alternatively, you may struggle to apply a skill on a question because that skill doesn't apply to those questions. For example, predictions are less useful in the Games section.

When questions are difficult, you might shift to puzzle practice. For example, you might use the right answer to see what clues you missed in the argument that could have helped you make a better prediction.

Or difficulty might indicate that you need more knowledge. To improve your knowledge you might go re-read the predictions pages, or explore how other guides approach the idea of predictions.

## Puzzle Practice

Puzzle practice is luxurious. It's a chance to dig into all the nuances of the test. To notice all the tiny clues it gave you. To figure out what everything means. To recognize the test's key [patterns].

For example,

- Once you know what the correct answer is, let the correct and incorrect answers teach you how the LSAT thinks.
- Try re-doing old questions in new ways, strange ways, uncomfortable ways, even ways you're pretty sure are wrong. No one's going to get hurt. Maybe you'll find better ways.

Puzzle practice is the best way to learn the test.

**Keep track of the lessons you learn in puzzle practice by making [flashcards] and [checklists].**

## Race Practice

Race practice is an attempt to practice like you want to play.

Race practice is timed, since the test is timed. But you don't always need to use the test's timer.

Give yourself more time at first, then increase the time pressure gradually.

Base your timing goals not on where you wish you were, but where you actually are.

You will mess up. You'll forget what to do. You'll fall into old habits. And that's a good thing. Mistakes are information.

Race practice makes you accountable. It shows you what you haven't really learned yet.

**Track your race errors with an error log. [Here's an error log template in google sheets format][error-log]**

## Each Type Of Practice Informs The Others

Your races will generate mistakes, which become questions to puzzle over.

Patterns emerge from your puzzling, which become skills to work on.

When you've done enough specific skill work, see if you can keep it together during a race.

Keep your practice interesting by switching up your pace and objectives.

## Evaluate Yourself Based On Your Intentions

Don't blame yourself because your race wasn't as thorough as a puzzle. Don't worry that you puzzled too slowly.

If your intention was to, say, make a prediction before you looked at the answers, don't judge yourself based on whether you got it right; instead, judge your prediction.
