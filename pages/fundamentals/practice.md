Do not muddle these types of practice. Choose one in advance, and stick to it.

1. Skill Work: perfect your process, iteratively.
2. Puzzle Mode: experiment to learn how the Test works.
3. Race Mode: move quickly (but never hurry).

## Skill Work

Since the LSAT is a test of skill, Skill Work is the most important practice.

Here are the steps of Skill Work:

1. Set an intention: Pick ONE skill you want to work on.
1. Try it.
1. Reflect on how it went: Did you do it? Was it useful? Was it appropriate?
1. Revise your intention: Make it more specific so you can do it better next time. Or choose a different skill to work on first.
1. Repeat.

For example, you might...

1. Resolve to make Predictions.
1. It doesn't go so well. You get 5 Qs in and realize you haven't Predicted once.
1. So you write "predict" on a sticky note.
1. You try again, one Q at a time.
1. If it goes poorly, maybe you need to work on Understanding, first.
1. If it goes better, your predictions probably helped more on some Qs than others.
1. You could dig into the harder Qs to see what clues you missed (but that would be a switch to Puzzle practice).
1. Or perhaps you need to pay more attention to the Q Type, since different Q Types reward different kinds of Predictions.
1. Next time, you resolve to first determine the Q Type and then make a Prediction appropriate to that Type.
1. You try again.

## Puzzle Mode

Puzzle Mode is luxurious and untimed. It's a chance to dig into all the nuances of the test. To notice all the tiny clues it gave you. To figure out what everything means.

Once you know what the correct Answer is, let the correct and incorrect Answers teach you how the Test thinks.

Try re-doing Qs in new ways, strange ways, uncomfortable ways, even ways you're pretty sure are wrong. No one's going to get hurt. Maybe you'll find better ways.

Puzzle Mode is the best way to learn about the Test. It's most useful at the beginning of your studies.

## Race Mode

Race Mode is an attempt to practice more like you want to play.

Race Mode is timed, since the Test is timed, but it shouldn't be the Test's timer.

Give yourself more time at first, then increase the time pressure gradually.

Base your goals on where you are, not where you want to be. High expectations have pros and cons.

You will mess up. You'll forget what to do. You'll do it wrongly. And that's a good thing. Mistakes are information.

Race Mode makes you accountable. It shows you what you haven't really learned yet.

## Each type of practice informs the others

Your Races will generate mistakes, which become Qs to Puzzle over.

Themes emerge from your Puzzling, which become Skills to work on.

When you've done enough hyper-specific Skill work, see if you can keep it together during a Race.

Keep your practice interesting by switching up your pace and objectives.

## Judge yourself by your intentions

Don't complain that your Race wasn't as thorough as a Puzzle. Or that you Puzzled too slowly.

Don't beat yourself up for not doing A when your intention was to do B.
