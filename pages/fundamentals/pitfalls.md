The LSAT is not a test of your Knowledge.

The LSAT is unlike the SAT/ACT, college exams, and the Bar Exam. All of these test Knowledge.

Learning the LSAT is more like learning to play an instrument or a sport. It is a Skills test.

Since the LSAT is a different kind of test, here's how to study differently:

## Quality > Quantity {#quality}

*Pitfall #1: You do as many questions as you can, hoping to magically absorb how the Test works.*

This is an understandable mistake, because it works on Knowledge tests. And it is a tempting mistake, because it might work at first.

Actually mastering a skill requires focused and intentional practice. 

[Learn more about intentional skill practice here.][1]

You will be happier and more productive if you do fewer questions with more focus.

When you do fewer questions, you allow yourself to objectively notice what you're doing while you're doing it. Then you can use those observations to change your behavior. And changing your behavior is the only way to change your score.

## Make Helpful (Not Lazy) Takeaways

*Pitfall #2: You avoid your mistakes.*

You practice without reviewing. Or you check the answer right away and say "oh, duh!" and learn nothing.

You haven't needed to deeply review before. On knowledge tests, the correct answer immediately teaches you the right lesson. Like: "Oh, the U.S. Constitution took effect in 1789 not 1776, duh!" But the LSAT doesn't repeat in the same way. The test you actually take will have all brand new questions.

Reviewing mistakes might be painful. But avoiding this pain will lead to lazy takeaways, meaning takeaways that won't help you later.

For example, this is a lazy takeaway:

> Pay attention to what "electromagnetism" means.

That's a Knowledge takeaway, and not a very useful one.

And here's another, common, lazy takeaway:

> Read more carefully.

But were you trying to read recklessly?

When you make these lazy takeaways you're being unkind to yourself. You'd never give a friend such unhelpful and judgmental advice.

In contrast, a helpful takeaway is kind because it is concrete. A helpful takeaway tells you exactly how to behave and when to behave that way. A helpful takeaway changes your behavior.

## Memorize Everything You Can

*Pitfall #3: You have no system or, worse, a jumbled system.*

On a knowledge test, everything needs to be memorized. But that doesn't work on the LSAT.

You can't memorize most of the LSAT. You can learn how to draw common games, but you can't know which ones will show up on your actual test. You can learn the flaws, but you also need to be able to spot those flaws in unfamiliar contexts.

Some studiers react to this difficulty by abandoning any hope of developing a system. Let's call these studiers *Cowboys* because they rely on guts and intuition. Cowboys inefficiently reinvent the wheel every time.

Other studiers react by doubling-down. Let's call them *knights*. Knights hope to protect themselves from the whims of the Test by accumulating more and more knowledge about the Test. They study endlessly, reading all the books, but never asking whether any of that knowledge actually helps them. As this knowledge accumulates, it weighs the Knight down like a heavy suit of armor.

Strong test takers find a balance between these two extremes. A useful system channels your good intuitions and corrects your bad intuitions. 

Here are four suggestions to find the balance:

1. Memorize knowledge, but practice skills. For example, memorize the common conclusion keywords. And then practice spotting them in the wild.
1. Make a flashcard for everything that feels obvious so that it stays obvious.
1. Keep it simple. If you can't simplify what you learned, then perhaps you haven't fully understood it. Plus simple ideas are easier to memorize.
1. Test your knowledge against the test. Revise or discard any knowledge that does not help you.

## The Timer Is A Teacher, Not A Judge

*Pitfall #4: You fear the timer's judgment.*

You always practice at full speed. Or you never time yourself.

Ironically, these are both symptoms of the same mistaken belief: that being able to finish an LSAT section in time is an accurate reflection of your intelligence or worth.

When you only practice at full speed, you let the test control you. Sometimes you need to slow down in order to learn new things. Sometimes, you need to slow down for hard questions.

When you never practice at speed, you avoid failure but you also avoid testing your approach.

When you do set a timer, use the time to gather information:

- Use the objectivity of a count-up timer to see where you spend time.
- Use the pressure of a count-down timer to reveal what's not automatic (or necessary) in your process.

## Learn From The Test And Yourself, Not Experts

*Pitfall #5: You defer to the experts, you don't trust yourself.*

You think you need an expensive course or that the biggest books are the best. But those teachers don't have access to secret knowledge. They learned about the test by taking the test. Their techniques are based on their own struggles.

[Read more about the problem with test prep experts here][6]

Try to figure things out for yourself before you turn to the experts.

The best way to learn is to struggle and fail. Struggle engages you actively, leading to deeper learning. And the failures of *your* practice show *you* what *you* need to look out for.

[Learn more about puzzle practice, the practice of sticking with problems, here.][7]

## Growth Happens Non-Linearly

*Pitfall #6: You're frustrated. Your failures and successes feel out of control.*

A knowledge test provides linear rewards: the more you study, the more you know. The more you know, the better you do.

Learning a skill is less linear. More effort will not always lead to better results. You will not hit your personal record every lap. You may leap forward, slip backwards, or stagnate on a plateau.

The remedy, paradoxically, is to attend less to your score and more to your *process*. You cannot directly control your score, but you can control your process. Pay more attention to what you can control.

## Rest

*Pitfall #7: You grind and cram.*

You drive yourself crazy studying all weekend. You study the same way for months or years. You learn to hate the test. You begin to avoid the test because studying sucks. Then, as test day approaches, you panic. You cram.

But you cannot cram or grind a skill. It would be better, on the LSAT, to be unprepared but rested and relaxed.

Growth and inspiration happen while you rest. Weightlifters and poets don't work more than 4.5 hours a day and neither should you.

Within those 4.5 hours, I favor 90 minute chunks of work. Others like 25 minute pomodoros. Experiment to find what works for you.

Make sure your rest is actually restful. I like taking 2 non-consecutive rest days, one on a workday, one on a weekend. I also prioritize sleep, eating vegetables, and exercise (in that order). But do whatever you need.
