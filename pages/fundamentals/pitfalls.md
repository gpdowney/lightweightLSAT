The LSAT is not a test of your Knowledge.

The LSAT is unlike the SAT/ACT, college exams, and the Bar Exam. All of these test Knowledge.

Learning the LSAT is more like learning to play an instrument or a sport. It is a Skills test.

Since the LSAT is a different kind of test, here's how to study differently:

## Quality > Quantity

*Pitfall #1: You do as many Qs as you can, hoping to magically absorb how the Test works.*

This is an understandable mistake, because it works on Knowledge tests. And it is a tempting mistake, because it might work at first.

For example, you can't get better at the piano without playing (you shouldn't wait to get a PhD in music theory before you start playing). But after some early gains, just whacking-away at a piano isn't going to make you more musical. Whacking-away is mostly a good way to build bad habits.

Actually mastering a skill requires [focused and intentional practice][1].

You will be happier and more productive, if you do fewer Qs with more focus.

When you do fewer Q, you allow yourself to objectively notice what you're doing while you're doing it. Then you can use those observations to change your behavior. And changing your behavior is the only way to change your score.

## Make Helpful (not Lazy) Takeaways

*Pitfall #2: You avoid your mistakes.*

You practice without reviewing. Or you check the Answer right away and say "oh, duh!" and learn nothing.

You haven't needed to deeply review before. On Knowledge Tests, the correct answer immediately teaches you the right lesson. Like: "Oh, the U.S. Constitution took effect in 1789 not 1776, duh!" But the LSAT isn't so obvious.

When you avoid your painful mistakes, you tend to make Lazy Takeaways, meaning takeaways that won't help you later. Like:

> Pay attention to what "electromagnetism" means.

That's a Knowledge takeaway, and not a very useful one.

Or you tell yourself something vague like:

> Read more carefully.

But were you trying to read recklessly?

A Lazy Takeaway is UNKIND. You'd never give a friend such unhelpful and judgmental advice.

In contrast, a Helpful Takeaway is KIND and CONCRETE. A Helpful Takeaway CHANGES YOUR BEHAVIOR. It tells you exactly how to behave and when to behave that way.

## Memorize everything you can

*Pitfall #3: You have no system or, worse, a jumbled system.*

On a Knowledge test, everything needs to be memorized. But that doesn't work on the LSAT.

You can't memorize most of the LSAT. You can learn how to draw common logic games, but you can't know which ones will show up on your actual test. You can learn the famous flaws, but you also need to be able to spot those flaws in unfamiliar contexts. 

Some studiers react to this difficulty by abandoning any hope of developing a system. Let's call these studiers [Cowboys][2] because they rely on guts and intuition. Cowboys are inefficient because they need to reinvent the wheel every time.

Other studiers react by doubling-down. Let's call them Knights. These Knights hope to protect themselves from the whims of the Test by accumulating more and more knowledge about the Test. They study endlessly, reading all the books, but never asking whether any of that knowledge actually helps them. As this knowledge accumulates, it weighs the Knight down like a heavy suit of armor.

You need to find a balance between these two approaches. You need a system. A reliable system channels your good intuitions and corrects your bad intuitions. 

To make a useful system, memorize common patterns so that you can spot them effortlessly. But too much system will weigh you down.

Here are three suggestions to find the balance:

1. Memorize knowledge, but practice skills. For example, memorize the [Fact Keywords][9]. And then practice spotting them in the wild.
1. Make a [flashcard][3] for everything that feels obvious so that it stays easy.
1. Memorizing happens after understanding. And you haven't understood if you can't simplify. Plus, simple ideas in your own words are easier to memorize.
1. Test your knowledge against the Test. Revise or discard any knowledge that does not help you.

## The Timer is a teacher, not a judge

*Pitfall #4: You fear the Timer's judgment.*

You always practice at full speed. Or you never time yourself. 

Always timing yourself and avoiding the timer are both signs of the same mistaken belief: that being able to finish an LSAT section in time is an accurate reflection of your intelligence or worth.

The LSAT is not a measure of your intelligence or worth. I promise.

Do not let the Test control how you spend your time. Not in practice. Not on Test Day.

Ignore the timer when you're learning a new process. Give yourself space to try out new ideas.

When you do set a timer, use the time to gather information:

- Use the objectivity of a [count-up timer][4] to see where you spend time.
- Use the [pressure][5] of a count-down timer to reveal what's not automatic (or necessary) in your process.

## Learn from the Test and yourself, not experts

*Pitfall #5: You defer to the experts, you don't trust yourself.*

You think you need an expensive course; or that the biggest books are the best. But [those teachers][6] don't have access to secret knowledge. They learned about the Test by taking the Test. Their techniques are based on their own struggles.

You can [figure it out][7] for yourself.

In fact, you must practice to learn. The failures and struggles of *your* practice show *you* what *you* need to look out for.

## Growth happens non-linearly

*Pitfall #6: You're frustrated. Your failures and successes feel out of control.*

A knowledge test provides linear rewards: the more you study, the more you know. The more you know, the better you do.

Learning a skill is less linear. More effort will not always lead to better results. You will not hit your personal record every lap. You may leap forward, slip backwards, or stagnate on a plateau.

The remedy, paradoxically, is to attend less to your score and more to your *process*. You cannot directly control your score, but you can control your process. Pay more attention to what you can control.

## Rest

*Pitfall #7: You grind and cram.*

You drive yourself crazy studying for 6 or more hours at a time. You work away all weekend. You study for months or years. You learn to hate the Test. You begin to avoid the Test because studying sucks. Then, as Test Day approaches, you panic. You cram.

But you cannot cram or grind a Skill. It would be better, on the LSAT, to be unprepared but rested and relaxed.

Growth and inspiration happen while you rest. Weightlifters and poets don't work more than 4.5 hours a day and neither should you.

I favor 90 minute chunks of work. Others like 25 minute [Pomodoros][8]. Experiment to find what works for you.

I also recommend 2 non-consecutive rest days per week.

And give yourself a real deadline:

- If you want to gain 1-3 points, pick a test within 2 months.
- If you want to gain 4-6 points, pick a test 3-4 months away.
- If you want more points, don't pick a Test Day. Set a smaller growth target and a deadline within the next 1-2 months. On that date, set new goals.
