The LSAT is not a test of your Knowledge.

The LSAT is unlike the SAT/ACT, college exams, the Bar Exam, which all of these test Knowledge.

The LSAT is more like playing an instrument or a sport. It is a Skills test.

Since the LSAT is a different kind of test, you'll need to study for it differently.

This page is meant primarily for those who've been struggling with the LSAT, but it may also serve as a useful warning for novices.

## Quality > Quantity

\#1 BIGGEST PITFALL: You do as many Qs as you can, hoping to magically absorb how the Test works.

This is an understandable mistake, because it works on Knowledge tests.

For example, you can't get better at the piano without playing. But after some early gains, you're unlikely to become more musical by just whacking-away at a piano. It's better to jam randomly than to avoid touching the keys until you've learned all of music theory. But whacking-away is mostly a good way to build bad habits.

Actually mastering a skill requires [focused and intentional practice][1].

It is better to do fewer questions with more focus than many questions for no reason.

When you do fewer questions with less time pressure, you allow yourself to objectively notice what you're doing while you're doing it. Then you can use those observations to change your behavior, which changing your behavior is the only way to change your score.

## Make Helpful (not Lazy) Takeaways

2ND BIGGEST PITFALL: You avoid your mistakes.

You practice without reviewing. Or you check the Answer right away and say "oh, duh!" and learn nothing.

You haven't needed to deeply review before. On Knowledge Tests, the correct answer immediately teaches you the right lesson. Like: "Oh, the U.S. Constitution took effect in 1789 not 1776, duh!" But the LSAT isn't so obvious.

And you want to get away from your painful mistakes.

So you make Lazy Takeaways, meaning takeaways that won't help you later. Like:

> Pay attention to what "electromagnetism" means.

That's a Knowledge takeaway, and not a very useful one.

Or you tell yourself something vague like:

> Read more carefully.

But were you trying to read recklessly?

A Lazy Takeaway is UNKIND. You'd never give a friend such unhelpful and judgmental advice.

In contrast, a Helpful Takeaway is KIND and CONCRETE. A Helpful Takeaway CHANGES YOUR BEHAVIOR. It tells you exactly how to behave and when to behave that way.

## Memorize everything you can

Pitfall #3: You have no System or, worse, a jumbled System.

On a Knowledge test, everything needs to be memorized. But you can't memorize most of the LSAT. You can learn how to draw common logic games, but you can't know which ones will show up on your actual test. You can learn the famous flaws, but every LR question will be new, so you also need to be able to spot flaws in unfamiliar contexts. 

Some studiers react to this difficulty by abandoning any hope of developing a System. Let's call these studiers without any Systems [Cowboys][2] because they rely on their guts and intuitions. They reinvent the wheel every time.

Other studiers react by doubling-down. Let's call them Knights. The Knights try to make armor out of knowledge *about* the Test. They hope to protect themselves from the whims of the test by accumulating knowledge. They study endlessly, reading all the books, learning everything about the Test, but never asking whether any of that knowledge actually helps. As their knowledge accumulates, it becomes like a complex and heavy suit of armor. The Knight is weighed down by their knowledge.

You need to find a balance between these two approaches. You need a system. You need to learn a reliable system that corrects your bad intuitions. You need to memorize the common patterns so that you can spot them effortlessly. But too much system will weigh you down. Too much knowledge will get in the way of your good intuitions. 

Here are three suggestions to find the balance:

1. Memorize Knowledge and Practice Skills. For example, memorize the [Fact Keywords][9]. And then practice spotting them in the wild.
1. Make a [flashcard][3] for everything you learn here that feels easy. So that it stays easy.
1. Memorizing happens after understanding. And keep flashcards simple. If you can't simplify, then you haven't understood. Plus, simple ideas in your own words are easier to memorize.
1. Test your knowledge against the Test. Revise or discard any knowledge or skill that does not help you.

## The Timer is a teacher, not a judge

Pitfall #4: You fear the Timer's judgment.

You always practice at full speed. Or you never time yourself. 

Always timing yourself and avoiding the timer are both signs of the same mistaken belief: that being able to finish an LSAT section in time is an accurate reflection of your intelligence or worth.

The LSAT is not a measure of your intelligence or worth. I promise.

Do not let the Test control how you spend your time. Not in practice. Not on Test Day.

Ignore the timer when you're learning a new process. Give yourself space to try out new ideas.

When you do set a timer, use the time to gather information:

- Use the objectivity of a [count-up timer][4] to see where you spend time.
- Use the [pressure][5] of a count-down timer to reveal what's not automatic (or necessary) in your process.

## Learn from the Test and yourself, not experts

Pitfall #5: Deferring to the experts, not trusting yourself.

You think you need an expensive course; or that the biggest books are the best. You hope that if you learn a lot about the Test then your score will go up.

[Those teachers][6] don't have access to some secret knowledge. They learned about the Test by taking the Test. Their techniques are based on their struggles.

You can [figure it out][7] for yourself.

In fact, you must practice to learn. The failures and struggles of your practice show you what you need to know.

## Growth happens non-linearly

Pitfall #6: Frustration. Your failures and successes feel out of control.

A Knowledge Test provides linear rewards: the more you study, the more you know. The more you know, the better you do.

Learning a Skill is less linear. More effort will not always lead to better results. You will not hit your personal record every lap. You may leap forward, slip backwards, or stagnate on a plateau.

The remedy, paradoxically, is to attend less to your Score and more to your Process. A loss can be a great game, if you accomplished what you set out to do.

## Better to Rest than to Grind and Cram

Pitfall #7: Working too much.

You drive yourself crazy studying for 6 or more hours at a time. You grind away all weekend. You grind for months or years. You learn to hate the Test. You begin to avoid studying because it sucks. Finally, as Test Day approaches, you panic. You cram.

But you cannot cram a Skill. It would be better, on the LSAT, to be unprepared but rested and relaxed.

**Weightlifters and poets don't work more than 4.5 hours a day and neither should you.**

Growth and inspiration happen while you rest.

I favor 90 minute chunks of work. Others like 25 minute [Pomodoros][8]. Experiment to find what works for you.

And I recommend 2 non-consecutive rest days per week.

**Also, give yourself a real deadline.**

- If you need 1-3 points, pick a test within 2 months.
- If you need 4-6 points, pick a test 3-4 months away.
- If you want more points, don't pick a Test Day. Set a smaller growth target and a deadline within the next 1-2 months. On that date, set new goals.
