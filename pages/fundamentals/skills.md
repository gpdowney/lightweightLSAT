If you want to preview *the Lightweight LSAT* system, here a few techniques to try out that might help you get an extra point or three:

## Games

Do the IF questions before the WHICH questions.

(Or actually, do the LIST question first, then the IFs.)

*Why it works:* the IFs (and easy LIST) will give you valid hypos that you can use to prove or disprove answers on the WHICHes.

## Reading

Eliminate strong answers.

*Why it works:* passages tend to be nuanced, so strong answers tend to be unprovable.

## Reasoning

Anchor yourself in a basic understanding of the argument before you read the answers.

*Why it works:* You don't always need to spot the problem with the argument. You must always understand what the argument said.

## Timing

Breathe.

When you feel rushed or stressed out, stop for a second to regain control.

*Why it works:* Everyone struggles to maintain focus. Top scorers are just better at noticing when they lose focus and then bringing their focus back to what they need to do.
