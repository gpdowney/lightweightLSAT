Here's a few skills that I find useful:

## LG
Do the [IF Qs][if] first.

(Well actually, do the [easy LIST Q][easy] first, then do the IFs).

The IFs will give you valid Hypos that you can use on the WHICHes.

## RC
Eliminate [strong][strong] Answers.

Passages tend to be nuanced, so strong Answers tend to be unprovable.

## LR
[Anchor][anchor] yourself in a basic understanding of the Argument before you read the Answers.

You don't always need to make an exact prediction. You must always understand what the Argument said.

## Timing
Breathe.

When you feel rushed or stressed out, [stop for a second][reset] to regain control.
