## 3 sub-Species of PARALLEL questions

PARALLEL questions come in 3 flavors. You can tell them apart by their Arguments
(the questions can look similar).

Your job changes slightly depending oh which flavor it is.

### Conditional PARALLEL Questions

Diagram the Conditional logic of the Argument and (as needed) of the Answers.

### Flawed, Non-Conditional PARALLEL Questions:

Find the Flaw, pick the Answer that makes the same type of mistake.

### Non-Conditional, Non-Flawed PARALLEL Questions:

Pick out the structural words (ignore the content).

(Use right and wrong Answers to teach you what is and isn't structural)
