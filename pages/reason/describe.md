## 3 sub-Species of PARALLEL Qs

PARALLEL Qs come in 3 flavors. You can tell them apart by their Arguments
(the Qs can look similar).

Your job changes slightly depending oh which flavor it is.

### Conditional PARALLEL Qs

Diagram the Conditional logic of the Argument and (as needed) of the Answers.

### Flawed, Non-Conditional PARALLEL Qs:

Find the Flaw, pick the Answer that makes the same type of mistake.

### Non-Conditional, Non-Flawed PARALLEL Qs:

Pick out the structural words (ignore the content).

(Use right and wrong Answers to teach you what is and isn't structural)
