title: Boil Down the Content of an Argument

In addition to breaking an argument down into its structural components, you also need to boil down the content of an argument so you can understand it.

When you boil down an argument you attempt to simplify it without changing the meaning. Simplifying has two advantages:

1. The *act* of simplifying forces you to critically engage with the argument, and thus deepens your understanding.
2. The *product* of simplifying, your simplification, will be easier to remember after you start reading the confusing answers.

There are 3 main skills required to successfully boil down an argument. Each main skill is made up of several minors skills.

Main Skill | Minor Skills
-- | -- 
[Translate bad writing](#translate-bad-writing) | [Find the verb][verbs]; <br> [Fill in pronouns](#fill-in-pronouns); <br> [Resolve negatives into positives](#resolve-negatives-into-positives).
[Reduce to the essentials](#find-the-essential-terms) | Do it.
[Don't change meaning](#preserve-the-meaning) | Don't do it.

This page provides some advice for learning these skills.

## Translate bad writing

The LSAT is full of bad writing. It's bad on purpose, in order to confuse you.

Thankfully, the LSAT tends to reuse the same 3 bad writing tricks. You can learn to spot these tricks and see through them.

### Find the Verb

The LSAT hides verbs to obscure who is doing what. Rephrasing sentences so that they include a clear subject and verb is the single most important skill for making sense of the LSAT.

### Fill in Pronouns

You have to build up the argument before you boil it down.

Slow down when you see pronouns. Get clear about what words like "it" and "this" and "their argument" refer to.

### Resolve Negatives Into Positives

Positives are easier to handle than negatives.

Never don't resolve a double negative.

## Find the Essential Terms

It is difficult to describe, in the abstract, what's likely to be essential about an argument. Developing a sense of what matters to arguments on the LSAT is largely a matter of practice.

That said, here is some language that tends to be essential:

Category | Examples
-- | --
Conditional logic | *if, all, none, only, unless*
Normative claims | *should*
Modifiers | *some, most, can, may, not*
Causation clues | *causes, effects, leads to, contributes, benefits from*
Conjunctions | *and, or, nor*

{% capture summary %}
Review Tip: Use the answers to teach you what's essential.
{% endcapture %}
{% capture details %}
After you've checked the answer, you can use the right and wrong answers to teach you about what the LSAT thought was most important in the argument.

The right answers *will always* provide clues about what mattered in the argument. (But they don't always address *everything* that matters.)

The wrong answers *might* emphasize aspects of the argument that were meant to be distractions.

## Preserve Meaning

In boiling down arguments, you'll need to find a delicate balance between simplicity and fidelity.

Imbalance | Risk
-- | --
Over-simplifying | erasing distinctions; <br>missing details; <br>wasting time re-reading.
Under-simplifying | getting lost in the answers; <br>memorizing words rather than struggling with meaning.

Tips for finding the balance:
- Steal key terms instead of paraphrasing them.
- Don't add new ideas.

*Heuristics:* 
1. You can tell you changed it too much, if the wrong answers appealed to you.
2. You can tell you simplified too little, if the right answer didn't appeal to you.

## Examples

### Speeding

> Speeding is against the law, but no one doesn't do it. Still, it's not safe. They shouldn't expect to not get pulled over when they're doing it.

{% capture summary %}
Translate (but don't simplify it yet):
{% endcapture %}
{% capture details %}
> Speeding is illegal, but everyone speeds. Speeding is dangerous. So speeders should expect to get pulled over.
{% endcapture %}
{% include details.html %}

{% capture summary %}
What would be an oversimplification?
{% endcapture %}
{% capture details %}
Here's one example:
> Don't speed.
{% endcapture %}
{% include details.html %}

{% capture summary %}
Can you reduce it without losing meaning?
{% endcapture %}
{% capture details %}
Here's one option:
> Speeding is dangerous, so expect to get pulled over.
{% endcapture %}
{% include details.html %}

### Breakfast

> Breakfast, compared to dinner and lunch, isn't likely to possess a considerable degree of nutritional value. It is worse to consume something without nutritional value than it is to not consume it. Ergo, most people would be no worse off if they failed to consume breakfast.

{% capture summary %}
Translate and simplify. Then compare your version to mine:
{% endcapture %}
{% capture details %}
One way to translate and simplify:
> Breakfast is less nutritious than dinner or lunch. It's better to eat nothing than to eat something with 0 nutrition. Therefore, you can skip breakfast.
{% endcapture %}
{% include details.html %}

### The Doctrine of Standing

> There is a moral imperative for the establishment of a juridical equality that encompasses non-human beings' legal rights. Yet their ability to bring cases before the court, in the storied tradition of American jurisprudence, are never not denied under the doctrine of standing. It is obvious, then, that reforms to the doctrine of standing must be undertaken without delay.

{% capture summary %}
Translate and simplify. Then compare your version to mine:
{% endcapture %}
{% capture details %}
One way to translate and simplify:
> We should grant non-human beings equal legal rights. Non-humans cannot bring cases because of standing. Therefore, we should reform standing.
{% endcapture %}
