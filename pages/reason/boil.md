After you have divided an Argument into the Facts and the Conclusion, it can be helpful to simplify the Argument to its essential Point.

Boiling the Argument Down has three advantages:

1. It provides a check on your Understanding. If you can't simplify it, then you probably have not understood it.
1. It helps you make Predictions. A simplified Argument is easier to describe, argue or infer from.
1. It always gives you an Anchor as you move through the confusing Answers, even if your Prediction was off.

## Stealing > Paraphrasing.

You can (and sometimes should) use synonyms to simplify complicated words. But when you put the Argument into your own words, there's always risk that you'll change the meaning.

Stealing the key ideas is safer.

## Fill in Pronouns.

You have to build up the Argument before you boil it down.

Slow down when you see pronouns. Get clear about what words like "it" and "this" and "their argument" refer to.

## Turn Negatives into Positives.

Positives are easier to handle than negatives.

Never don't resolve a double negative.

## Watch out for commas.

Commas can change the direction of sentences and Arguments.

## Verbs

Verbs drive meaning. They tell you who is doing what. But verbs are often hidden on the LSAT.

[Find the verbs](verbs.html).

## An Example:

> Speeding is against the law, but no one doesn't do it. Still, it's not safe. They shouldn't expect to not get pulled over when they're doing it.

{% capture summary %}
Translate the verbs and negatives and pronouns (without reducing it yet):
{% endcapture %}
{% capture details %}
> Speeding is illegal, but everyone speeds. Speeding is dangerous. So speeders should expect to get pulled over.
{% endcapture %}
{% include details.html %}

{% capture summary %}
Now reduce it to a minimum:
{% endcapture %}
{% capture details %}
> Speeding is dangerous, so expect to get pulled over.
{% endcapture %}
{% include details.html %}

{% capture summary %}
Be careful not to Over-Boil and lose important meaning:
{% endcapture %}
{% capture details %}
> Don't speed.
{% endcapture %}
{% include details.html %}
