## Tip: How to tell the difference between INFER and ARGUE questions

On ARGUE questions, correct Answers are Assumptions. An Assumption is a missing Fact you add back to the Argument.

On INFER questions, correct Answers are Inferences. An Inference is a missing Conclusion that follows from the Facts.

This means that INFER questions only give you Facts. (In contrast, ARGUE and DESCRIBE questions usually give a whole Argumentâ€”Facts + Conclusion.)

## There are 5 question Species in the INFER Family:

1. [Most Supported](#most-supported)
1. [(Dis)Agree](#disagree)
1. [Must be True](#must-be-true)
1. [Must be False](#must-be-false)
1. [Rule](#rule)

MOST SUPPORTED and (DIS)AGREE questions are ORGANIC because a Flexible Prediction will be most useful. And for both, favor MODEST Answers.

Make Specific Predictions and Diagrams on the MECHANICAL INFER questions: Must be True, Must be False, and Rule.

*Caution: Do Not Confuse the Reasoning process with the Games process for MBT/MBF. You cannot use the lessons you learn here on Games (or vice versa).*

*Bonus: You can apply the lessons you learn for Reasoning Most Supported questions to Reading Medium questions (and vice versa).*
