Verbs are crucial. Verbs are, literally, the action of a sentence. But verbs are often hidden on the LSAT, as they are hidden in much legal writing.

Here's what the author Annie Dillard ([as repeated by Alexander Chee](https://themorningnews.org/article/annie-dillard-and-the-writing-life)) says about verbs:

    You want vivid writing. How do we get vivid writing? Verbs, first. Precise verbs. All of the action on the page, everything that happens, happens in the verbs. The passive voice needs gerunds to make anything happen. But too many gerunds together on the page makes for tinnitus: Running, sitting, speaking, laughing, inginginginging. No. Don’t do it. The verbs tell a reader whether something happened once or continually, what is in motion, what is at rest. Gerunds are lazy, you don’t have to make a decision and soon, everything is happening at the same time, pell-mell, chaos. Don’t do that. Also, bad verb choices mean adverbs. More often than not, you don’t need them. Did he run quickly or did he sprint? Did he walk slowly or did he stroll or saunter?

Finding the verb is the most important skill for understanding the LSAT (and for improving your own writing, which is how you will be graded in law school).

Verbs hide in two related ways: 

1. passive voice and 
2. nominalizations.

## Passive Voice

You may have heard of the evils of passive voice. In a passive sentence, the subject and object of a sentence are switched.

For example, compare:

    X loves Y.

This sentence uses active voice. The subject `X` acts on `loves` the object `Y`.

    Y is loved by X.

This sentence uses passive voice. The object and subject are switched compared to the active sentence. The object `Y` is acted on `is loved by` by the subject `X`. And we must add in a weasel verb `to be`. And notice, in this passive construction, the subject `X` could be left out, entirely erasing them:

    Y is loved.

Similarly, compare this passive sentence:

    Verbs are often hidden on the LSAT.

Versus this active sentence:

    The LSAT hides verbs.

Notice how the first (passive) version minimizes the LSAT's responsibility. Passive voice obscures who does what.

Passive voice can be justified when it moves familiar ideas to the beginning of a sentence. When sentences begin with familiar ideas, readers don't need to work as hard. So sometimes it is kind to use the passive voice.

## Nominalizations

Of lawyers' many bad writing habits, nominalizations are the worst (and [acronyms][acronym] are a close second).

A nominalization is a verb that has been turned into a noun.

Compare this nominalization:

    Obtain a view of Spot while they are performing the activity of running.

vs.

    See Spot run.

Or this nominalization:

    A nominalization is a verb that has been turned into a noun.

vs.

    You nominalize when you turn a verb into a noun.

Defeat nominalizations by rewriting the sentence with a meaningful verb.
