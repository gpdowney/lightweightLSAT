## Bonus: How to Negate on DEPENDS questions. {#negate}

You should only Negate on DEPENDS questions.

When you Negate the correct Answer, the Argument will fall apart.

> If a wall is load-bearing, then the house depends on it. And there's a easy way to tell if a wall is load-bearing: knock it down.
> 
> [If the roof falls on you, then it was load-bearing][1].

When you Negate the correct Answer, you should feel a "Woah! That's bad for the Argument"

When you Negate the wrong Answer you should feel: "Huh." The Argument does not Depend on the wrong Answers, so Negating them won't do anything.

Negation does not mean opposite. The Negation of a statement is the minimum required to disprove it.

Example:

> You never say anything nice.

Opposite:

> You only say nice things.

Negation:

> You said a nice thing once.

Here are some common negations:

**Idea**        |   **Negation**
Is              |   Isn't
I am            |	I am not
I am always     | 	I am sometimes not
I am never      | 	I am sometimes
If A, then B    | 	If A, maybe not B
All             | 	Some not
None            | 	Some
Some            | 	None
Most            | 	Most not
