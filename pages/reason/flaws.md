title: How to Argue (on the LSAT)

All ARGUE Family Arguments have at least one Problem. Just knowing that they have a Problem is not enough. To make a Flexible (ORGANIC) or Specific (MECHANICAL) Prediction, you must be able to say what the Problem is. 

## Truth vs. Validity {#truth}

The LSAT doesn't care about Truth; it only cares about Validity. A Valid Argument follows the rules of logic.

This means that you don't try to prove the Argument is false, you try to prove that it was badly made. To challenge the Argument's Validity, you accept the Facts, but question whether they support the Conclusion.

In real life, you (hopefully) evaluate arguments based on their Truth.

If Chicken Little says to you:

> Run! The sky is falling.

You're likely to question their Fact. You'll say:

> It doesn't seem like the sky is falling to me.

But on the LSAT, you can't raise this objection. You must accept the Truth of Chicken Little's Fact.

Instead, you must challenge the connection between their Fact and their Conclusion:

> Okay, the sky is falling. But how will running help us?

## Problems vs. Solutions. {#solutions}

When someone tells you a story about their rotten day, it's rude to immediately solve their problem. More than rude, that solution will often be inappropriate because you've rushed to a judgment before understanding the whole picture.

Better to listen carefully until the real problem is revealed.

Even better to let them propose some solutions. Then, you can weed out the solutions that don't actually address the problem.

This is also how you should approach ORGANIC questions: find the real Problem, don't get tied to one solution, and then Eliminate Answers that are IRRELEVANT to the Problem.

## 3 Types of Problems

Warning: Spotting Flaws and Gaps and What Ifs may be useful in law school, but you must promise not to use these argumentative skills on loved ones or the social medias. (I say this not to protect others, but for your benefit.)

1. GAPs: the Facts are not completely connected to the Conclusion.
1. WHAT IFs: there's an alternative explanation for the Facts or the Conclusion.
1. FLAWs: the Argument committed a common error.

These types overlap. 
- Some Flaws, like [Fresh Ideas in the Conclusion][1] and [Conditional Errors][2] feel more like Gaps. 
- Other Flaws, like the [Causation][3], [Sampling][4] and [Comparison][5] Flaws are more likely to raise What Ifs.

Gaps tend to be most useful on JUSTIFY questions. What If thinking helps on ORGANIC questions. Both help on DEPENDS questions.

Consider this argument:

> The t-shirt is on sale. So you should buy it.

{% capture summary %}
Do you see a Gap?
{% endcapture %}
{% capture details %}
Here's one (not the only one):
> "On sale" is not connected to "should buy"?
{% endcapture %}
{% include details.html %}

{% capture summary %}
How about a Flaw?
{% endcapture %}
{% capture details %}
Here's one (not the only one):
> "Should" is a strong Fresh Idea in the Conclusion.
{% endcapture %}
{% include details.html %}

{% capture summary %}
Any What-Ifs come to mind?
{% endcapture %}
{% capture details %}
Here's some:
> You don't like t-shirts.
>
> They're sold out.
>
> You're a freegan who never buys anything.
>
> It's a cotton t-shirt and you're a carnivore who only wears leather and wool.
{% endcapture %}
{% include details.html %}

Notice: What are the chances your exact What If appears in the Correct Answer? Not nothing, but not high. Theres a vast range of possible objections; that's why you need to stay Flexible on ORGANIC questions.

## The Common Flaws {#flaws}

Lists of all known logical errors and their Latin names are available elsewhere. Here are the 5 errors worth memorizing:

1. [Fresh Ideas in the Conclusion][1]
1. [Conditional Errors][2]
1. [Association isn't Causation][3]
1. [Bad Samples][4]
1. [Bad Comparisons][5]

### Fresh Ideas in the Conclusion {#poptart}

Charlatans love this move: They begin with obvious Facts to make themselves seem commonsensical, then they leap to their grand, unsupported Conclusions.

To spot this error in the wild: Look for big or shiny words in the Conclusion.

See if you can spot the Fresh Ideas in the Conclusion of these three bad Arguments:

{% capture summary %}
*We all want to be rich. So we need to shrink big government.*
{% endcapture %}
{% capture details %}
Where did "Big Government" come from? Why is "shrink" the solution?
{% endcapture %}
{% include details.html %}

{% capture summary %}
*Only 5 employees voted yes. Therefore a majority opposed the measure.*
{% endcapture %}
{% capture details %}
5 is an absolute number. Majority is a relative number, so "Majority" is a new idea.
{% endcapture %}
{% include details.html %}

{% capture summary %}
*We all liked the movie trailer. So we must go see the movie right now.*
{% endcapture %}
{% capture details %}
Woah, right now? That's very strong. So "right now" and "must" are suspect.
{% endcapture %}
{% include details.html %}

### Conditional Errors {#conditionalerror}

Conditional errors read the arrow backwards or flip the direction of the arrow.

To spot these errors in the wild: Look for conditional logic keywords (especially "only if").

Consider this true conditional:

> All squares are rectangles.

It is legal to flip it and negate it; that gives us the Contrapositive:

> If it's not rectangle, then it can't be square.

But it is illegal to just negate it:

> If it's not a square, then it can't be a rectangle.

And it is illegal to just flip it:

> If it's a rectangle, it must be a square.

Note: the LSAT describes these two illegal moves as "confusing a necessary for a sufficient condition."

### Association isn't Causation {#cause}

Causation is not always an error. We know that smoking causes cancer. But causation is very hard to prove. Think of how long it took to prove that smoking causes cancer.

To spot this error in the wild: Look for association words in the Facts and causation words (or active verbs) in the Conclusion.

Humans brains like the neatness of causation too much. We rush to conclude causation from association.

> Whenever we see Ash at a party, we also see Bee. Obviously, we conclude, Ash has asked Bee out.

Our "obvious" is vulnerable to three objections: (1) random chance, (2) a 3rd cause, and (3) reversed causation.

1. We haven't been invited to that many parties. Maybe someone else often spots Ash at parties without Bee, or Bee without Ash.
2. Sia independently invites both Ash and Bee.
3. Bee asked out Ash.

### Bad Samples {#sample}

To spot this error in the wild: look for studies and numbers.

The more the LSAT describes a study, the more suspicious you should be. Unlike real life, if the LSAT says "Research shows that Dogs are smarter than Cats" that's a Fact you should accept.

Bad samples are (1) small, (2) unrepresentative, and/or are studied with (3) suspect methods.

Consider these three:

1. Observations of 30 Americans revealed that Americans rarely wear deodorant.
1. Observations of 10,000 children revealed that people rarely wear deodorant.
1. A telephone survey of 10,000 Americans revealed that Americans rarely wear deodorant.

{% capture summary %}
What's the Problem?
{% endcapture %}
{% capture details %}
1. 30 people is too small a group to conclude anything about hundreds of millions of people.
1. Children might not act like adults. Maybe they have another reason for not wearing deodorant.
1. The sample seems OK, but maybe people lie on the phone.
{% endcapture %}
{% include details.html %}

### Bad Comparisons {#compare}

The comparison error takes two forms:

- These things are alike in one way, so they must be alike in another way.
- These things are different in one way, so they must be different in this other way.

For example:

- Elephants and Mice are both grey mammals. Elephants are large. So mice are also large.
- This apple is red and sweet. That fruit is green and tart, so it is not an apple.
