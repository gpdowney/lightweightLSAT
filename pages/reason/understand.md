This page outlines the second Reasoning step and most important skill: *understanding the argument.*

There are two aspects to understanding:

1. **Break down** the argument to distinguish the facts from the conclusion.
2. **Boil down** the argument to the essential point, without changing it.

Breaking down an argument reveals its fundamental structure, then boiling it down helps you grasp what it actually means.

## Break it Down

Every argument has two fundamental parts: 

1. the **facts**, and
2. the **conclusion**

The facts are the support, and the conclusion is the claim. There may be several facts, but there will only be one conclusion.

Note: There might also be **context** or an **antithesis**.
{% endcapture %}
{% capture details %}
The context and antithesis are not essential to understanding, but they provide useful clues.

The context defines the argument's terms and scope.

The antithesis is what the argument is *against*. Knowing what the argument is against can help you anticipate what it will argue *for*.

You need to separate the facts from the conclusion because **you must accept the facts.** The LSAT does not care whether an argument is objectively *true* in the real world, but only whether it is a ***valid*** argument, aka whether it has a solid logical structure.

There are three ways to distinguish the facts from the conclusion.

Feeling | Facts may *feel* more objective or modest. Conclusions may *feel* bigger or more subjective.
Flow | Facts lead to the conclusion.
Structural words | Fact words point to facts and conclusion words point to the conclusion. <br>(And pivot words point to the antithesis.)

Of these three, structural words are the most efficient and reliable strategy. Using your feelings or the flow of the argument may feel more intuitive, at first, but feelings and flow both require more mental energy and are frequently subverted by the LSAT.

Consider, for example, this argument:

    Read my book for I am the greatest writer of all time.

{% capture summary %}
Which part is the fact and which part is the conclusion?
{% endcapture %}
{% capture details %}
The fact is: `I am the greatest writer of all time.`

The conclusion is: `Read my book.`

Feeling is unreliable here because `greatest of all time` is a huge claim, while `read` is a modest ask. There's no guarantee on the LSAT that facts will feel fact-y and conclusions will feel conclusion-y.

Flow is unreliable here because the conclusion comes first. The LSAT often reorders words to disrupt the flow of an argument.

If you were able to see past those confusions using feel or flow, congrats! Perhaps you can rely on your intuition to break down arguments on test day. But notice how much energy it took and if you were able to be 100% confident.

The fastest, most reliable, and lowest-brain-power method is to spot the *fact word* `for`. `For` introduces the idea `greatest writer...` which means that's the fact, and the remaining part `read my book` must be the conclusion.

## Boil it Down

To boil down an argument is to *simplify* it. Simplifying the argument has several advantages:

- The act of simplifying deepens your understanding by forcing you to think critically about the words on the page.
- A simple understanding will be easier to hold on to as you move through the confusing answers.

There are 3 keys to simplifying arguments:

1. Translate bad writing.
1. Identify the essential terms.
1. Don't change the meaning.

> Bonus: Lawyers, judges, and legal academics are, in general, bad writers. So this skill is relevant to law school and the practice of law.

## Summary

You break down an argument in order to reveal its structure.
Learning how to break down an argument is relatively straightforward application of knowledge.

You must:

1. Memorize the fact, conclusion, and pivot words; then
1. Practice spotting those words on real LSAT questions.

You boil down an argument in order to grasp its meaning.
Learning how to boil down an argument involves a more difficult process of calibrating skills.

You must:

1. Revise bad writing; 
1. Calibrate your sense of what's essential; and 
1. Find the balance between over- and under-simplifying.
