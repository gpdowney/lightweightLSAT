## Your most important task on every Reasoning question is to UNDERSTAND the Argument.

All the tricks in the world can't help you if you don't Understand what the Argument said. Understanding is the foundation for everything else you'll do.

## Understanding has 2 Steps:

1. Break it down: distinguish the Facts from the Conclusion
1. Boil it down: get Anchored in the Argument's essential Point.

## Argument Structure

Every Argument, on the LSAT, has two parts: (1) the FACTS and (2) the CONCLUSION.

The Facts are meant to support the Conclusion. There may be several Facts, but there will only be one Conclusion.

The Facts and the Conclusion will be contained in distinct clauses. You do not need to add anything or extract secret ideas. The Argument will give you everything you need.

You must, on the LSAT, [accept that the Facts are True][truth]. You can only question whether they support the Conclusion.

So, to Understand the Argument, you must first distinguish the Facts from the Conclusion. There are three ways to [BREAK DOWN][break] Arguments: Feel, Flow, and Keywords.

And, then, you must [BOIL DOWN][boil] the Argument to its essential point. So that you can easily ANCHOR yourself in your Understanding before you make a Prediction or move into the Answers.
