## The Anatomy of a Logical Reasoning Q

[![example of a LR Q][1]][1]

## The 5 Steps for Every Logical Reasoning Q

1. Know your Job
1. Understand the Argument
1. Predict
1. Eliminate, Defer, Select
1. Move On or Revise

## Know Your Job

Read the Q first. The Q tells you what you need to do.

Every Q has a Family and a Type. The Family tells you what you need to Understand about the Argument. The Type tells you what kind of Prediction you can expect to make. Some Qs are special (and common) enough to have their own name, these Qs have a Species.

Memorize the keywords that tell you which Q is which. Memorize your Job on each.
Understand the Argument.

Understanding is foundational. You cannot succeed on an LR Q without Understanding.

There are 2 steps to Understanding:

1. Break Down the Argument into its Facts and Conclusion.
1. Boil Down the Argument to its Essential Point.

## Predict

Always Predict. Predictions neutralize the LSAT's most devious trick: confusing Answers.

There are three types of Prediction:

- Anchor Predictions ground you in your Understanding.
- Flexible Predictions identify the Argument's Problem (not its Solution).
- Specific Predictions exactly anticipate the correct Answer.

## Eliminate, Defer, Select

Prefer this order:

1. Eliminate bad answers.
1. Defer on Weirdo answers.
1. Pick the least bad answer.

## Move On or Revise

If you can't make 4 Eliminations or 1 Selection, then you've proved this was a difficult Q.

Always Flag these Qs for review. And always Reset to interrupt your mistake.

You have two options:

1. Move On: Do it later or never.
1. Revise your analysis of the Argument or the Answers.
