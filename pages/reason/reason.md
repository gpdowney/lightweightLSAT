## The Anatomy of a Logical Reasoning Q

[![example of a LR Q][1]][1]

## The 5 Steps for Every Logical Reasoning Q

1. Know your Job
1. Understand the Argument
1. Predict
1. Eliminate, Defer, Select
1. Move On or Revise

## Know Your Job

Read the Q first. The Q tells you what you need to do.

Every Q has a Family and a Genus. Many Qs also have a Species.

The Family tells you what you need to Understand about the Argument. 

The Genus tells you what kind of Prediction you can expect to make. 

And some common Qs have an even more specific task, so these Qs also have a Species.

For example, consider this Q:

> Which of the following assumptions, if true, makes the argument logically valid?

### Species

I know that it's a JUSTIFY Q because I've memorized that this string of keywords--"assumption", "if true", "valid"--indicates a JUSTIFY Q. 

I strongly recommend making *flashcards* to help you recognize Qs automatically. To be smooth on Test Day, you want to make Q Recognition as automatic as possible. Memorizing will save you time and help you get clear about what exactly you need to do on each Q. 

Some Qs don't fit into the normal categories, but knowing the normal categories will help you more quickly process these unusual Qs.

Of course, you can always figure out what a Q is asking on Test Day, but ***thinking is expensive***. 

### Family

JUSTIFY Qs are in the ARGUE Family. We can tell because the Q tells us there's an "argument" and that the argument has a problem. We know the argument has a missing assumption, which the correct answer will provide. 

In the ARGUE Fam, we're always looking for the Problem in the argument. We read to find a Problem, even on these JUSTIFY Qs when we're ultimately trying to help the Argument. You have to diagnose the Problem before you can prescribe a solution.

### Genus

And JUSTIFY Qs are of the MECHANICAL Genus. On MECHANICAL Qs we can expect to make Specific Predictions. That is, we can expect to know almost exactly what the correct Answer will be, before we look at the Answers.

On a JUSTIFY Q, we know there will be a Gap between the Facts and the Conclusion. Since we know both sides of the Gap, we can Predict exactly what ideas the correct Answer will connect.

### A Quiz

When you feel confident in your ability to recognize Q's, [try this Quiz][2].

## Understand the Argument.

Understanding is foundational. You cannot succeed on an LR Q without Understanding.

There are 2 steps to Understanding:

1. Break Down the Argument into its Facts and Conclusion.
1. Boil Down the Argument to its Essential Point.

## Predict

Always Predict. Predictions neutralize the LSAT's most devious trick: confusing Answers.

There are three types of Prediction:

- Anchor Predictions ground you in your Understanding.
- Flexible Predictions identify the Argument's Problem (not its Solution).
- Specific Predictions exactly anticipate the correct Answer.

## Eliminate, Defer, Select

Prefer this order:

1. Eliminate bad answers.
1. Defer on Weirdo answers.
1. Pick the least bad answer.

## Move On or Revise

If you can't make 4 Eliminations or 1 Selection, then you've proved this was a difficult Q.

Always Flag these Qs for review. And always Reset to interrupt your mistake.

You have two options:

1. Move On: Do it later or never.
1. Revise your analysis of the Argument or the Answers.
