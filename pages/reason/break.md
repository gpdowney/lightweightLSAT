1. FEEL
1. FLOW
1. KEYWORDS

This list is ordered from worst to best, From least reliable (and most cognitively expensive) to most reliable (and easiest to think).

## 1. Feel

Sometimes you just feel like a sentence is the Conclusion.

Conclusions may feel like opinions. While Facts will feel, well, factual. Be careful with this intuitive method: there's no rule that Conclusions must be opinions and Facts must be facts.

## 2. Flow

All arguments have a Flow: The Facts support the Conclusion.

Be careful, FLOW is not the same as order. The LSAT loves to mess with the order of words and sentences.

When you use Flow you will be tempted to think that the idea at the end is the conclusion. To be fair, the end is often the Conclusion. Be wary. The Conclusion can often be in the beginning or middle.

Flow is not about what comes first or last, it's about what supports what. The supporting idea is the Fact. The supported idea is the Conclusion.

Flow is a valuable tool to have, but an expensive one to use.

## 3. Keywords

Argument KEYWORDS are reliable and easy.

Once you look for them, they should be easy to spot. And once you spot them, they give you the structure of the argument.

There are three types of ARGUMENT KEYWORDS:

- Conclusion
- Fact
- Pivot

### Conclusion words

Conclusion words introduce the Conclusion.

Conclusion words include:

- Thus
- Therefore
- So
- Hence

For many test-takers, conclusion words are obvious. Because many people will notice them, they are less useful and potentially untrustworthy. (Can you guess when they might be less useful or trustworthy?) Conversely, if you don't notice them, you'll be a step behind.

If the conclusion words seem obvious to you, you might not need to memorize them. Still, you should practice consciously looking for them. So that you can, later, notice them unconsciously with even less effort.

### Fact words

Fact words introduce the Facts.

Fact words include:

- FOR
- AFTER ALL
- BECAUSE
- SINCE

Memorize this as F.A.B.S.

When you know what the Facts are, you can also tell what the Conclusion is.

For example:

> Since I scored a 180, you should listen to me.

The FABS word "Since" introduces the Fact: "I scored a 180," Which means the idea after the comma: "you should listen to me" is the Conclusion.

We could change the order (and the FABS word) without changing the meaning:

> You should listen to me because I scored a 180.

The Conclusion is still "listen" and the Fact is still "180."

Most test-takers are not looking for Fact words. (Which could change if this guide becomes very popular.) That means noticing them will give you an edge. And they are trustworthy.

### Pivot words

Pivots introduce the Argument's IDIOTS. In other words, Pivot words separate the Point and the OPPOSING point.

(This makes Pivots especially valuable on RC.)

Pivot words include:

- BUT
- HOWEVER
- ALTHOUGH
- YET

Pivots help us get clear about what they author is for and against. Instead of getting confused by an Argument that changes direction, Pivots help us use the shift to Understand the Point more clearly.

Consider this example:

> Software companies argue that strong intellectual property protections are necessary to promote innovation. But there's plenty of innovation in clothing fashions even though fashion designs can't be patented or copyrighted. We could eliminate patent and copyright protections for software.

The Pivot word "but" means the software companies are the Idiots here. So the Conclusion is probably the opposite of whatever they believe. So without conclusion words or fact words or flow or feeling, we can know that the Conclusion is: "intellectual property isn't necessary for software."

Notice, in this example, we could switch the order of the last two sentences without moving the Pivot or changing the meaning. A Pivot can come before either a Fact or a Conclusion, but it usually comes *after* the Idiots.
