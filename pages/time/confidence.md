## Confidence is the key to speed

Waffling is where most of the time goes. (Waffling indicates under-confidence.)

Staring takes up the rest. (Staring indicates over-confidence.)

If you don't feel at all confident, then fake it till you make it.

Remember, there's no cost to missing a practice Q.

In fact, that's useful information.

Trust yourself to learn when, specifically, you can't trust yourself.

## Confidence is not Arrogance, Agony, or Anxiety

### Arrogance isâ€¦

- When you only do RACE practice: As soon as you learn something, you try to do it at full speed on the hardest Qs.
- When you blame luck or the test or "stupidity" for your mistakes. And then don't learn from them.
- When you expect every Q to be easy, so you don't notice when the Test is hard.
- When you don't let the Test show you when you don't understand something.

### Agonizing is when you only do PUZZLE practice

Puzzling is useful, but if you only practice this way, it will become a bad habit.

When you agonize over every Q, you don't give yourself a chance to fail or to succeed. You don't let yourself see what you're really good at and what you actually do need to work on.

If you agonize over the last 2 Answers in practice, then you'll do that on Test Day too.

And agonizing over the last 2 Answers is not a good investment of your limited time anyways, even during practice.

### Anxiety is different than stress

Everyone is stressed by the LSAT. The LSAT is a challenging, high stakes test.

Stress can be productive. Stress can focus and motivate you.

If you interpret your stress as a good thing, then it might become useful.

### Anxiety is *unproductive* stress

Anxiety has as many causes and manifestations as there are human beings. But it has two common effects on the LSAT:

1. Anxiety distracts you.
2. Anxiety disrupts your game-plan.

Anxiety impairs test performance when it takes you away from solving the Q in front of you.

And anxiety makes the test harder when it encourages reactive, rather than proactive, behavior.

For example, anxiety might lead you to...

- Rush. You just want to get it over with.
- Avoid practicing new skills. You crave the comfort of familiar methods, even if those old methods are likely to lead to the same old results.
- Set low expectations. You let the test beat you before you've even begun, because you think it will insulate you from disappointment.

## Avoid practicing Anxiety

If you notice yourself feeling Anxious, overwhelmed, or distracted for any reason:

1. Stop.
2. [Reset][1].

When you're too anxious (or tired, or whatever) to practice right, don't practice.

Instead, exercise, drink water, nap, eat, meditate, or take care of business.

Try again when you can approach the Qs with confidence and integrity.

That said, don't give up too fast or postpone studying just because you "don't feel like it". Sometimes you need to warm up to get in the mood.

## If your anxiety feels out of control, ask for help

Therapy is wonderful.
