## Resets can be short or long

Close your eyes. Notice one breath. Make a coffee. Walk around the block. Take a day off.

As short as half a second or as long as you need.

## Resets put you back in the drivers seat

Use them to remind yourself why you're here and what you need to do next.

## My favorite is a 3-part reset

Make this a ritual:

1. Breathe.
2. Physical Action.
3. Affirmation.

For example:

1. Breathe squarely: 4 seconds in, 4 seconds hold, 4 seconds out, 4 seconds hold.
1. Touch each finger tip to your thumb.
1. Think: "You got this."

## Reset frequently

Maybe every question. Definitely every hard question.

Reset whenever you notice yourself looking at the words on the page, but not actually reading them.

Reset whenever you notice yourself distracted.

Especially whenever you notice yourself distracted by anxiety.

## Resets are not judgments or distractions

A judgment is a type of distraction. If you judge yourself during your reset, then reset again.

Don't seek out distractions during your resets. Seek out focus and clarity instead.

## Practice resets intentionally

Do a section without content-based goals. Just practice noticing when you need a reset and then doing it without judgment.
