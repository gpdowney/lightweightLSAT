When you feel like you can't get any faster, it may be useful to attempt a radical change.

Sprints are a specific kind of Race Practice.

The idea is this: when you've been riding a bicycle at 10mph, 20mph feels recklessly fast. In contrast, after driving at 60mph on the highway, a 30mph street feels painfully slow.

## Practice at unreasonably fast speeds to change your sense of normal

For example:

- Games: 1 game in 4:00.
- Reading: normal read (~3:00) then 0:20 per question.
- Reasoning: 6 questions in 3:00.

Make the time a Hard Stop so that you really feel the constraint.

The first time you do these sprints, you may feel awful. You may feel far from your goal.

Try again. Literally, the same questions.

With practice, you will rise to the challenge.

## Sprint only after you've achieved competence on the questions you're likely to do

Sprint on easier questions, or even questions you've already done.

## Know that you will make more mistakes and that's the point

The extra time pressure will reveal what parts of your process are not smooth and automatic.

Or you even may find that some of your process is unnecessary.
