When you feel like you can't get any faster, it may be useful to attempt a radical change.

Sprints are a specific kind of Race Practice.

The idea is this: when you've been riding a bicycle at 10mph, 20mph feels recklessly fast. In contrast, after driving at 60mph on the highway, a 30mph street feels painfully slow.

## Practice at unreasonably fast speeds to change your sense of normal

For example:

- RC/LG: 1 passage/game in 4:00.
- LR: 6 Qs in 3:00.

Make the time a Hard Stop so that you really feel the constraint.

The first time you do these sprints, you will feel awful. You will feel far from your goal.

Try again. Literally, the same Qs.

With practice, you will rise to the challenge.

## Sprint only after you've achieved competence on the Qs you're likely to do

Sprint on easier Qs, or even Qs you've already done.

## Know that you will make more mistakes and that's the point

The extra time pressure will reveal what parts of your process are not smooth and automatic.

Or you may find that some of your process is unnecessary.
