When timing yourself you don't always need to use a *count-down* timer. You can also use a *count-up* timer, like a stopwatch.

The advantage of a count-up timer is that (1) there's less pressure and (2) you can track your laps.

Laps give you more detailed information about where you're spending your time. For example:

When you hit the lap button | What it tells you
-- | -- 
After each game | How much time each game took. <br> How much time you left for the last game.
After each question | Which questions are hard for you.
After each step in the process within a single question | Where your process isn't smooth. <br>If you're actually doing every step.

The more often you lap, the more information you get, but the more you interrupt your flow.

Laps help improve our sometimes unreliable sense of time.

> 1. You might feel like you're moving blazing fast because your brain was working like crazy to figure out a game. But in reality, you spent 2 minutes just staring at the page.
> 
> 2. Or you might feel like you're moving painfully slowly while making a hypothetical to disprove an answer. But in reality it only took you 30 seconds and it allowed you to eliminate 3 answers.

Laps provide a more objective perspective on how you spend you time.

You can then use this more objective information to identify problem areas and make an informed plan about where you actually want to invest your time.
