## If you don't drive, the LSAT will

And the LSAT is a terrible driver.

Take charge of how you spend your time.

## Spend different amounts of time on different types of questions

## Difficulty is *SUBJECTIVE* on the LSAT {#subjective}

It doesn't matter what question it is.

If you think it's hard, then it's hard.

Don't ignore these feelings, practice noticing them. If you can notice when the test is more and less difficult for you, then you can invest your time more strategically. You can slow down for hard questions and speed up for easy questions.

### Maybe skip the hardest questions

Each question is worth 1 point.

Don't get sucked into the hardest questions if you're just going to guess at the end.

Decide what questions you want to skip, instead of letting the Test decide for you. Always aim to get to the end of the section.

### Trust yourself to crush the easy questions

If you like 1 Answer or hate 4 Answers, then move on with confidence.

Don't overthink it. If you get it wrong, you can review it later.

When you crush easy questions, you earn extra time to invest on hard questions.

## Selected Drills

As with everything in this guide, adapt these drills to your needs.

Adjust as you go. Set incrementally higher expectations when you're successful. Or make your expectations more reasonable, if you struggle to meet them.

### Splits

Practice normally, but track your splits.

A count-up timer can be a nice alternative to the pressure of a count-down timer.

You can split more or less often. You could, for example, split

- Every 5 questions
- Every question
- Each step within a single question.

The more often you split, the more information you get, but the more you interrupt your flow.

Splits are descriptive and objective: they show you where you're investing your time. You can then use this information to identify problem areas and decide if you're investing time wisely.

### Plan to Flag

Practice with a plan to Flag X questions:

X depends on your current score...

- If you're new or scoring below 150: plan to flag 10+ questions per section.
- 151-157: flag 8.
- 157-163: flag 6.
- 163-167: flag 4.
- above 167: flag 2.

### Practice Speed on Easier questions

Generally, earlier questions tend to be easier.

If you are <160...

- Reading/Games: first passage/game in 7:30 min / first two passages/games in 15:00.
- Reasoning: first 5 questions in 5:00 / 10 in 10:00.

If you are >160...

- Reading/Games: first passage/game in 6:00 / first two in 12:00.
- Reasoning: first 5 questions in 4:00 / 12 questions in 10:00.

### An Games drill

Spend the minimum time possible on Set-Up (ideally around 0:30).
Get into the questions and start making Hypos to prove and disprove Answers.

### An Reading drill

Unlimited Reading time. Then 0:30 (or 0:45) per question.
