The three keys to getting faster on LSAT are:

1. [Memorization](#memorize-everything-you-can);
1. [Treating the Timer as a Teacher](#use-the-timer-as-a-teacher); and
1. [Confidence](#appropriate-confidence).

## Memorize Everything You Can

Knowledge of the test can slow you down.

You don't want to waste time, for example, trying to remember what a question's type is, or rediscovering how to draw a rule.

To make your knowledge useful you need to make it automatic. The best way to make knowledge automatic is a spaced repetition system, like Anki. [Learn about spaced repetition and Anki here.][anki]

In addition to memorization, you must practice *applying* your knowledge. Repetition is what turns abstract knowledge into automatic habits.

Checklists can help you build the right habits. [Learn more about checklists here.][checklist]

You can improve the speed and reliability of minor skills with rapid fire practice. 

For example, choose a old Reasoning section and try to name each question's type as fast as possible. Review the questions that took you more than 2 seconds to recognize. Make a flashcard with the keywords that indicated the question type. Repeat until you can do it seamlessly.

Similar drills could work for...
- Game types
- Game rules
- Reading question size

## Use the Timer as a Teacher

Most students think of the timer as a judge. A more helpful (and less stressful) perspective is to think of the timer as a teacher.

The timer can reveal at least two crucial pieces of information.

1. The pressure of a count-down timer can reveal what you haven't yet made automatic.
2. Laps on a count-up timer can reveal where you're currently investing your time.

The first shows you that you might need to recommit to your skill practice.

The second shows allows you to identify the biggest time sucks and then specifically address those.

## Appropriate Confidence

Both a lack of confidence and an excess of confidence can be major time sucks.

&nbsp; | acts like every question is | wastes time by | cured by
-- | -- | --
under-confidence | hard | waffling | faking it till you make it
over-confidence | easy | staring | allowing yourself to make more mistakes in practice

In contrast, appropriate confidence allows you to distinguish hard questions from easy questions.

> Note: Difficulty is *subjective*. What matters is if you feel like it's hard or easy.

Making this distinction then allows you to decide where to invest your time, both in practice and on test day.

### Skip the Hardest Ones

Being confident in yourself means knowing your limitations.

When you run into an impossible game, text, or question, skip it. It might make more sense if you come back later.

Or if you know that a certain question type befuddles you, automatically skip those.

Each question is worth the same: 1 point. By strategically skipping the hardest questions, you can give yourself time to earn more points by answering all of the easier questions.

### Crush the Easiest Ones

Being confident in yourself allows you to recognize when something is easy.

The LSAT wants you to doubt yourself on the easy questions. But you can gain a great deal of time if you just let easy questions be easy.

For example, when you love 1 answer and hate the other 4, choose the answer you love and move on. Practice not overthinking it. If you get it wrong, you can review it later.

The only way to have enough time to get the hardest questions right is to crush the easy ones.
