## Every passage has a conflict

If you don't think there's a conflict, look again.

Obviously, there are exceptions to this rule, but they are rare.

> Life hack: When someone says something is "obvious" it rarely is. When someone says "clearly" they're trying to hide an argument.

## The conflict will not be a simple binary

Not A vs B:

- Dogs are better than cats.
- The Proletariat must resist the oppression of the Capitalists.

Rather, nuance:

- You cannot understand the evolution of anti-trust law without understanding neoliberalism.
- Torts and Contracts are functionally the same area of law.
- Although judges claim to be neutral, ideology predicts the outcome of cases more reliably than precedent.

To understand the conflict, you should understand both the *content* and the *degree* of the disagreement. Know what the author believes, know what they're against, and know how strongly they're against it.

## Find the author's purpose

Many Passages come from academic or journalistic sources. Academics and journalists write because they believe they have some brilliant insight on the topicâ€”an unusual or novel take. And every word is there for a reason.

So, as you read, ask yourself: WHY did they write this?

Or, similarly, ask yourself: What *work* is this word/sentence/paragraph doing for the author?

## Whenever possible, identify the thesis sentence

The thesis sentence is a single line that summarizes the main point.

You can often find the thesis near the beginning, often at the end of the first paragraph. In rare cases, the thesis appears at the end.

## Other clues worth noticing:

- Topic sentences
- Pivot words (but, yet, however, although)
- Strong language (must, no, cannot, should, etc...)
- Repetition
- Roadmap Sentences ("first we will show X, second we prove Y...")
- Questions
- Characters (they can be people or theories)
