You can [ELIMINATE](#eliminate), [DEFER](#defer), or [SELECT](#select) an Answer. 

(There are no other (good) options. Dithering is a bad option.)

What you look to do first will depends on [the Size of the Q](size.html).
- On Larger Qs: Eliminate.
- On Smaller Qs: Select.

Moving decisively through the Answers it the best way to gain speed in Reading Comprehension.
- Eliminate when you know it's wrong.
- Select when you know it's right.
- Defer when you don't know.

## Eliminate Poisoned Answers {#eliminate}

Wrong Answers are often Poisoned by a specific word or phrase. 

Immediately cross out any Answer that you have a *reason* for eliminating. 

(If you don't have a reason, consider Deferring. Poison is more than: "it doesn't *feel* right.")

Poison can come from either:

1. content, or
2. strength.

If an Answer is part-sweet and part-Poison, it's all wrong.

## Defer on Weirdos {#defer}

Weirdos are Answers that you 

1. don't understand or
2. aren't sure about.

Don't spend too much time on a Weirdo. Don't even try to understand it. They might be confusing because they are confused.

Once you evaluate all 5 answers, there's two possibilities:

1. If you found an Answer you like, you don't need to explain why the Weirdo is wrong.
2. If you got rid of every other Answer, then you can pick the Weirdo and move on. You don't always need to explain why it's right.

## Select Answers you Love {#select}

Don't rush to select an Answers you "like," wait to select an Answer you *love* it.

On Larger Qs, if you fall in love early, still scan all the other Answers to make sure they're Poisoned.

On Smaller Qs, when you find an Answer you love, immediately go back to confirm that it's proved by the text.

When you don't find love in the Answers, select the LEAST WRONG Answer.

## Evaluating Answer choices is not unlike swiping on a dating app {#swipe}

When you see a deal-breaker (all group photos, no group photos, a fish photo, a political endorsement, a messy bathroom selfie, etc...) swipe left without hesitation.

If you need to swipe left 5 times then swipe left 5 times. Don't lower your standards on the apps! You deserve better.

But on the LSAT, there's only 5 eligible Answers. So once you swipe left 5 times, you do actually need to go back and lower your standards.

And, like dating, having some detailed list of requirements will get in your way. Sure, know what you don't like. But maybe don't go in looking for something so specific. Be open to the right ideas in new words.

## CAUTION: Be very careful of "I don't remember that" as a reason to eliminate {#dont-remember}

If you rely on your memory to make eliminations, you'll have to memorize the passage.

Plus, this is an unreliable approach. Large Qs are likely to phrase the main idea in weird ways. Medium Qs are allowed to include new information. And on Small Qs, you should Defer on "I don't remember" rather than eliminating.

If you notice yourself relying on "I don't remember that," you might need to work on your Predictions. You might need to deliberately practice predicting, to make it a habit. Or you might need to improve the accuracy of your predictions by improving the quality of your read.

If you do eliminate based on "I don't remember that" make sure that you also think "And I would have remembered it." or, even better, "And they wouldn't have said that."
