**Re-reading** and **Pausing** are the 2 most valuable skills for RC (and maybe even for the whole LSAT)

Re-reads and Pauses help you move at your own pace.

## Re-read often

Try reading the first paragraph twice.

Try reading the whole passage twice.

Or try re-reading in small bursts

Re-read without judgment. Judgment is a distraction. And remember, you're supposed to re-read.

### Re-read important ideas

Trust your own sense of importance. If you think it's important, you're probably right.

### Re-read when you're confused.

Trust your confusion. If you think you're confused, you're definitely right.

Confusion feels unpleasant, so you will be tempted to run away from it. Resist the temptation to flee from difficulty. Stick with your confusion. 

Use your confusion as a guide. When you're confused, ask yourself:

- What am I confused about? Sometimes just articulating your confusion clears it up.
- Is this worth trying to understand? If not, move on.
- Should you read the sentence again?
- Or should you look for context elsewhere? Perhaps the topic sentence of the paragraph will help. Maybe there's a clarifying example or definition coming up.

### Don't get stuck

A re-read or two is always appropriate. Four or more re-reads is sign that:

- You aren't focused and need to [reset][reset], or
- whatever it is, it's not clicking and you should move on for now.

## Each re-read has its own purpose and pace.

When you re-read, you should have a goal. Some question you want to answer. Or a nuance to understand more deeply.

And when you re-read, it shouldn't happen at the same pace as your first read:

- Your re-read can be a skim, when you just want to confirm or extract a detail.
- Or your re-read might need to be slower, when you were confused the first time.

For example:

1. A first read might be speedy and relaxed. Get oriented. Look for the overall WHY of the Passage.
1. A second read digs deeper. It slows down, but only in targeted places. You look for nuance and understand how the WHATs fit together.

You could also reverse the order of those reads. As always, experiment to learn what works for your brain.

## Pause often.

Pauses allow you to think while you read.

In RC, you cannot merely look at the words on the page. You must also synthesize meaning. You must assess the claims being made.

 But [your brain cannot read and synthesize and assess simultaneously][multitask]. So stop from time to time to reflect and digest. 

It doesn't have to be a long stop.

### Good times to Pause:

- Between paragraphs;
- At the end; and
- Anytime you would re-read.
