## Myth 1: You can't improve your RC score

Maybe you've heard from someone that RC isn't improvable. That someone couldn't improve their own score or they couldn't help you improve. This belief only proves that they don't understand the RC section.

Maybe you're doing pretty well on RC and figure: "eh, good enough." But why? Why tolerate lost points here but not elsewhere? RC is fully 1/3rd of your score.

Or maybe you're having a bad time with RC but think: "how could I get better at reading?" Well, that's why you're here.

RC requires a different kind of reading.

- It's not the same as reading journalism or fiction.
- It's not the same as reading for most college courses.
- It's not even the same as reading for other standardized tests.

### You can get better at RC if you read differently, if you read for the nuanced conflict

Understanding conflict is, thankfully, very relevant for law school.

## Myth 2: You should read faster

The LSAT is a terrible place to start speed-reading.

If you want to learn how to speed-read, practice speed-reading on something else, something easier than the LSAT.

And don't skim either. You cannot skim on RC because every word matters. (Although not every word matters equally.)

### Instead: Read at the pace of your understanding

Speed on RC comes from CRUSHING the Qs, which you can only do if you INVEST in the READ

You will finish with time to spare if you spend:

3:00 on the read (+/- 0:30); and

0:45 per Q (+/- 0:15).

(3:00 x 4 passages) + (0:45 x 27 Qs) = 32:15

## Myth 3: You must memorize the passage

You want to memorize and speed-read at the same time?? Woah, no wonder you're having a hard time.

Memorizing a bunch of boring, random facts is impossible, or at least very time consuming.

### Better to find the WHY of the passage

Rather than trying to memorize a bunch of discrete WHATs, look for the WHY behind the passage. 

The WHY connects the WHATs together. The connections you make trying to understand the WHY will help you remember all the WHATs you need.

And RC Qs are more likely to ask about the WHY of the Passage, anyways.

Only a few of the WHATs will be tested, and when that happens you can go back to the Passage.

## Myth 4: You need a complicated system of notes

Notes have three major disadvantages:

1. Note-taking consumes precious time.
1. Underlining/highlighting replaces understanding. You note that something was important, instead of thinking about WHY it's important.
1. Taking notes, especially while reading, distracts you with detail. You get caught up in the WHATs.

### Try taking no notes instead

Whenever you would take a note, pause to synthesize instead.

If, after trying no-notes, you decide you must take notes, then your notes should:

- Happen after you understand; and
- Be minimalist (just a few words).
