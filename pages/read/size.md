The Qs in Reading Comprehension fall on a spectrum from Large to Small. 

How you approach a Q depends on its size.

[Large Qs](#large-qs) are about the whole passage. On Large Qs, you should make a prediction. You should ground yourself in your understanding of the Passage's nuanced conflict. Your prediction should help you *eliminate* 4 confused Answers.

[Small Qs](#small-qs) are about details. On Small Qs, you should Go Back to the Passage to prove the correct Answer. You Go Back in order to select the 1 right Answer.

[Medium Qs](#medium-qs) are everything in between. On Medium Qs, you Predict *and* Go Back. 

Medium Qs are sometimes larger, more about the big picture. On larger Medium Qs, you should make 3-4 eliminations. 

Sometimes Medium Qs are smaller, more about a detail, in which case you might only be able to make 1-2 eliminations before Going Back to prove the Answer you like.

## Large Qs

These are about the entire passage.

> Which of the following most accurately expresses the main point of the passage?

or

> What is the purpose of the third paragraph?

You should always have a prediction for these. Your prediction should allow you to confidently eliminate the 4 wrong Answers.

If you don't have a strong prediction (or your prediction was wrong), then you didn't do a solid enough read.

You may or may not like the correct Answer. If you like it, then you can afford to be more skeptical with the rest. If you don't like any Answer, choose the LEAST WRONG Answer.

## Small Qs

These are about specific details. The correct Answer will be a quote from the passage.

> According to the passage, which of the following is true of Wittgenstein's philosophy?

or

> The passage contains information sufficient to answer which of the following questions?

Always Go Back to the Passage on Small Qs.

Option: Before you Go Back, scan the Answers to know what to look for.

Once you confirm an Answer in the Passage, choose it and move on.

If you don't know *where* to Go Back, then your read was too high-level, you didn't use the WHY to understand the WHATs. You didn't integrate the details into the main point.

If you didn't need to Go Back, you might have been reading too much for detail (or you got lucky or you have a very good memory).

## Medium Qs.

Medium Qs are special because they often go beyond the Passage. Correct Answers may include new ideas, but they will always be grounded in the text.

Medium Qs can be difficult. You can make them easier by eliminating overly strong answers. Very strong answers are unlikely to be supported by the text.

*Practice Tips:*

- Deliberately look for strength in the Passage and every single Answer.
- Only use strength to make eliminations (don't even read the Passage).

### Medium Qs can be larger or smaller.

Large-Medium Qs go to the author's core belief.

> Which of the following would the author be least likely to agree with?

or

> Which of the following would most strengthen the author's position?

Small-Medium Qs might be about the purposes of a detail or otherwise require a re-read before predicting.

> Why did the author mention the Teapot Dome Scandal?

or

> Which of the following is most analogous to the relationship between European and African sparrows as described in the passage?

### Here's a 3-Step Process for approaching any Medium Q

#### Step 1: Predict for 2-4 eliminations.

Stay grounded in what the author believes. Your Prediction doesn't need to be specific. Use your Prediction primarily to eliminate confused Answers.

If you don't have a Prediction (say, because the Q is about a small detail) you can Go Back in order to make a Prediction.

#### Step 2: Eliminate strong Answers.

Answers will go beyond the text, but we don't want to go too far beyond.

The LSAT likes to make tempting traps by saying the right kind of ideas too extremely.

In RC, in general, extreme Answers are unlikely to be supported by the text.

#### Step 3: Go Back for support for the Answer you like.

Confirm the correct Answer and move on.
