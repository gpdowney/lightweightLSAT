## Pay what you can

Buy me a [coffee][coffee] ($5) or a [pizza][pizza] ($25) or many coffees and pizzas to support the site!

## Patronage

Don't think of this as a payment for value. Don't think of yourself as a customer.

Instead, think of yourself as a patron.

Patronage means supporting projects you like not because they benefit you, but because they benefit your community.

Your support will help to keep this guide free for everyone, forever.
