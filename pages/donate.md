The Lightweight LSAT is completely and permanently free.

There's no catch, no upsell, no paywalls, no ads. The site collects no user data. The content is open source, hosted on [GitHub](https://github.com/gpdowney/lightweightLSAT) and licensed under [Creative Commons BY-SA 4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/). And, unfortunately, I'm retired from LSAT teaching so I can't take your money to tutor you.

But if you wish to support this project, you can donate a few dollars.

## Pay what you can

Buy me a [coffee][coffee] ($5) or a [pizza][pizza] ($25) or many pizzas to show your love for the site!

## Patronage

Don't think of your donation as a payment for value. Don't think of yourself as a "customer." Instead, think of yourself as a patron.

Patronage means supporting projects you like not because they benefit you, but because they benefit your community.

Your support will help to keep this guide free for everyone, forever. (Or at least until the LSAT hopefully, finally becomes irrelevant.)
