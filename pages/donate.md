## Patronage

Don't think of your donation as a payment for value. Don't think of yourself as a customer.

Instead, think of yourself as a patron.

Patronage means supporting projects you like not because they benefit you, but because they benefit your community.

Your support will help to keep this guide free for everyone, forever.

## [Click here to donate][1]

Buy me a pizza ($25) or two ($50) or twenty ($500).

For reference: I charge $500/hour for tutoring. I spent at least 200 hours writing and designing this site. So it's worth $500*200. Wow, you got a deal!

(That was not the first [flawed][2] argument on this site. Keep your eye out for others.)
