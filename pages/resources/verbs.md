Verbs are, literally, the action of a sentence. But verbs are often hidden on the LSAT, as they are hidden in much of legal writing.

When verbs hide, the sentence obscures who is doing what. In other words, hiding the verb also hides the subject of the sentence. Obscuring verbs might be a good move for the LSAT and shady lawyers, but it's bad for you.

Verbs hide in two related ways: Passive Voice and Nominalizations.

## 1. Passive Voice

Compare

> Verbs are often hidden on the LSAT.

vs.

> The LSAT hides verbs.

Notice how the first version minimizes the LSAT's responsibility.

Passive voice is not always bad. Passive voice can be justified when it moves familiar ideas to the beginning of a sentence. When sentences begin with familiar ideas, readers don't need to work as hard. So sometimes it's kind to use the passive voice.

The true evil isâ€¦

## Nominalizations

A nominalization is a verb that has been turned into a noun.

Lawyers' have many bad writing habits. Nominalizations are the worst. Or, rather, the only thing worse than a nominalization is an [acronym](glossary.html#acronyms).

Compare:

> Obtain a view of Spot while they are performing the activity of running.

vs.

> See Spot run.

And:

> A nominalization is a verb that has been turned into a noun.

vs.

> You nominalize when you turn a verb into a noun.
