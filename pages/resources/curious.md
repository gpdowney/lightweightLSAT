The LSAT can feel cold and calculating. It often rewards robotic thinking. But it also rewards curiosity.

Cultivating an attitude of curiosity towards the Test has two major advantages:

1. Being curious will help make studying more fun and productive.
2. Being curious will help you avoid the Test's favorite tricks and traps.

## Curious Studying

When you get a Q wrong, it's easy to get frustrated. My first reaction is often: "That Q was unfair."

Fortunately, the LSAT is never unfair. The wrong Answers are always wrong for a reason. And there is only ever one right Answer.

Ultimately, getting frustrated is an excuse for avoiding mistakes. But this prevents us from learning.

If you get curious about your mistakes, you can turn your failures into specific and productive information. If you get curious, maybe you can find the poison in the wrong answer; or the clue in the text that could have helped you make a better prediction.

When you're uncurious, the Test is something that happens to you. When you're curious, you gain agency and control.

## Curious Test-Taking

Curiosity is an antidote to confirmation bias. And the LSAT loves to take advantage of confirmation bias.

You suffer from confirmation bias is when you look to prove your pre-existing ideas, instead of being open to disproof and new ideas. 

Confirmation bias shows up, most clearly in Logic Games on Must Be True Qs. On MBT Qs, the LSAT wants you to try to prove the Answers Could be True. But that doesn't really help. Just because it's true once doesn't mean it's always true. So it's actually [far more efficient to prove that the Answers Could be False](could.html).

In Logic Games, and the rest of the LSAT, being curious often means trying to disprove your assumptions.

Being curious means applying the same level of skepticism to each Answer.

Being curious opens you to strangely worded Answers, rather than chasing the false security of matching words.

Being curious helps you spot all the problems with an LR Argument, rather than getting wrapped up in a single solution.

Being curious helps you stay involved in an otherwise boring RC passage.

The best way to see through the LSAT isn't to have preexisting ideas or formula, it's to be curious about what's on the page in front of you.
