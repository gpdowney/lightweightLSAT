## Explanations are written by 170+ scorers who agonize for 30 min over all the nuances of one Q

And you expect yourself to see all that on Test Day? That's a ridiculous standard; it's unrealistic and it's unhelpful.

Sure, take time to learn how the Test works. Dig into the nuances during when you need to. And learn the Test's patterns when you do [Puzzle Practice](practice.html#puzzle-mode). But...

## Perfection is a risky plan for Test Day

Perfection is fragile and expensive. Perfectionism...

- Makes you doubt yourself even when you're right;
- Spends time you don't have.

The Test will not go perfectly.

- There will be something you haven't seen before.
- There will be something you don't understand.
- Time will seem to pass faster (or slower).

You will not perfectly understand everything on Test Day or even in practice. That's OK. I don't either.

## The only thing you can make perfect is your process

Always take the proper next step.

When you don't know what you could do next, that's when you look it up or ask for help.
