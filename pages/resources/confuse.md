title: How LR and RC Can Confuse You

There are 3 parts to every LR and RC Q (the Q itself, the Argument/Passage, and the Answers). This gives them 3 chances to befuddle you.

## The LSAT never allows itself to be confusing in the Q

If these instructions had any ambiguity, then multiple Answers might be correct. The LSAT could never allow that.

The primary virtue of the LSAT is that there is exactly one correct Answer. Answers are never better or worse. They're either right or wrong.

To be fair, the Q can be complicated. But a complicated Q gives you more specific instructions. If you follow those instructions, the Q should actually be easier.

## Arguments and Passages can confuse you with bad writing.

Nominalizations, passive voice, pronouns, opposing points, double negatives, confusing commas, conditional logic, etc...

Rushing through the Argument or the Read makes you vulnerable. Don't underestimate the value of [ Understanding](understand.html) and [Reading at the Pace of your Understanding](pace.html).

Still, there are limits to how confusing the Argument/Passage can get. A too ambiguous Argument/Passage might make one than one Answer correct. And again, that would be a diaster for the Test.

## The Answers are the primary tool the LSAT has to confuse you

There is *no limit to how confusing the Wrong Answers can be*. And there's 4 of them.

The Test-Makers know how your brain works better than you do. And with each Test they learn more. They have experimented with thousands of Answer choices on thousands of Test-Takers.

The Answers are not your friend. Unlike other standardized tests (or the LG section), you cannot use them to hack the Q.

### Be Prepared for the Answers

[Predictions protect you](predict.html) from the dangerous Answers. They allow you to check your Understanding and ruthlessly eliminate Wrong Answers.

### Be RUTHLESS with the Answers. {#ruthless}

The Answers do not deserve your time or the benefit of the doubt.

As soon as you know they're Wrong, cross them out.

You wear your raincoat when there's an 80% chance of rain.

### Approach the Answers SKEPTICALLY. {#skeptical}

Get rid of the distracting garbage first, instead of searching for the correct Answer.

The LSAT wants you to try to make Answers correct:

- To over- or under-read it,
- To add extra information,
- To excuse mistakes.

Avoid this trap by remaining Skeptical until you have one Answer left.

### Choose the LEAST BAD Answer. {#least-bad}

When you clear away the wrong Answers, you might be left with an Answer

1. You kinda like, or
1. You don't hate.

In either case, pick it and move on.

If two Answers seem correct, pick the better one. You should review this Q later (even if you get the Point) because **eliminating 3 is not good enough**. 

It's better to make 5 eliminations than 3. Making 5 eliminations lets you know that you need to [Move On or Revise](flag.html).
