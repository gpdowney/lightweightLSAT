First, a quick sports aside (via [David Epstein's *Sports Gene*][epstein]):

> It turns out that professional baseball players don't have faster than average reaction times. In fact, no human being has reflexes fast enough to respond to a 90 mph fastball. 
> 
> So how does anyone hit the ball? By predicting where it's going to go. Every time a baseball player swings, they're making a guess.
> 
> Better hitters make more educated guesses. The top players (1) see through the pitcher's attempts at disguise to (2) notice the tiny clues that actually matter, and (3) immediately know what those clues mean about where the ball is going. 

This is pattern recognition, and it's also the key to success on the LSAT:

1. See through the fluff to
1. Notice small clues, and 
1. Know, automatically, what those clues indicate.

There are three methods to improving your capacity to recognize the LSAT's pattern:

1. Brute Force
1. Reading about the test
1. Curiosity + Flashcards

## Brute Force

Doing question after question. This is the hard way.

To be clear, a certain volume of practice is required. Seeing lots of situations exposes you to the many varieties and disguises of each pattern. But volume itself is not enough. *Volume is necessary, but not sufficient.*

Without introspection and reflection, you're unlikely to learn from your reps. In fact, you're more likely to build bad habits.

## Reading About the Test

The minimum level of reflection is looking up how an expert solved the problems you got wrong.

This can be useful for seeing what patterns or clues helped the expert. It can be helpful when you feel completely stuck.

There's no shame in asking for help. But seeking out an expert should be your last resort because it deprives you of the opportunity to figure it out for yourself.

## Curiosity + Flashcards

Struggling through problems, aka [puzzle practice][puzzle], is

- a more active, and thus a more effective way to learn,
- a way to make takeaways customized to your brain, and
- an important skill for test day.

There are 2 keys to effective puzzling:

1. Curiosity
2. Flashcards

### Curiosity

It is cognitively (and emotionally) difficult to notice what you didn't notice. It is emotionally (and cognitively) difficult to see past your assumptions and change your default approach.

Getting [curious] is the key to both.

Open up space for curiosity by being generous with yourself.

- Give yourself time. If you redo a question immediately, you'll probably do it the same (wrong) way again. 
- Give yourself credit. You can figure this test out. There's always one right answer and four wrong answers; and you're allowed to know which is which before you start puzzling.

### Flashcards

To be useful, pattern recognition needs to become automatic.

It's not enough to learn the material, you also need to internalize it.

[Flashcards] in a *spaced repetition* system like ANKI, are a quick and effective way to internalize knowledge.

When something feels obvious after some puzzling, make sure it stays obvious by making it into a flashcard.

Remember, thinking is expensive. You cannot afford to waste time on test day figuring it out again or, worse, half remembering it.
