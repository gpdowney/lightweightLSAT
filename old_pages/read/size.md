title: Big, Medium, And Small Questions
cat: read

The questions in the Reading section fall on a spectrum from big to small. 

How you approach a question depends on its size.

[Big questions](#big) are about the whole text. On big questions, ground yourself in your understanding of the text before you look at the answers. This anchor prediction should help you *eliminate* the 4 confused answers.

[Small questions](#small) are about details. On small questions, quickly scan the answers and then go back to the text to *prove* the 1 correct answer.

[Medium questions](#medium) ask you to go beyond the text. Medium questions are sometimes bigger and sometimes smaller. Approach medium-big questions more like big questions, and medium-small questions more like small questions.

## Big Questions

Big questions are about the entire text.

    "Which of the following most accurately expresses the main point of the text?"

or

    "What is the purpose of the third paragraph?"

You should always have a prediction for big questions. Your prediction should allow you to confidently eliminate the 4 wrong answers.

You may or may not like the correct answer. 
- If you like one answer, then you can be more skeptical with the rest, but you should still read them. 
- If you don't like any answer, you can't be picky, choose the **least bad** answer.

{% capture details %}
If your prediction wasn't useful on a Big question, then you either...
1. Didn't understand the text's nuanced conflict; or
1. Didn't approach the answers with enough skepticism/confidence.

## Small Questions {#small}

Small questions are about specific details. The correct answer will be supported by a quote from the text.

    "According to the text, which of the following is true of Wittgenstein's philosophy?"

or

    "The text contains information sufficient to answer which of the following questions?"

On small questions, scan the answers first. Then go back to the text to find support for the answer you like. 

Once you confirm an answer in the text, choose it and move on.

{% capture details %}
If you didn't know *where* to go back, then your read of the text was too abstract or high-level.

If you didn't need to go back, you might have been reading the text too much for detail (or you got lucky, or you have a very good memory).

## Medium Questions {#medium}

Medium questions take you beyond the text. Correct answers will include new ideas and words, but they will always be grounded in the text.

Medium questions tend to be the hardest questions in the section. You can make them easier by eliminating strong answers. Strong answers are unlikely to be supported by the text.

1. Deliberately look for strength in the text and answers.
1. *Only* use strength to make eliminations (maybe don't even read the text).

### Medium-Big Questions

Medium-big questions go to the author's core belief.

    "Which of the following would the author be least likely to agree with?"

or

    "Which of the following would most strengthen the author's position?"

**On medium-large questions...first eliminate based on your overall understanding of the text, then go back to prove the answer you like.**

### Medium-Small Questions

Medium-small questions might be about the purposes of a detail or make an analogy to a specific example.

    "Why did the author mention the Teapot Dome Scandal?"

or

    "Which of the following is most analogous to the relationship between European and African sparrows as described in the text?"

**On medium-small questions, first go back in order to make a specific prediction, and then eliminate answers that don't match.**
