The optimal way to approach the Reading section is to...

1. invest in understanding the text, so that you can
2. crush the questions.

## Invest In The Text

Investing in the text means moving at the pace of your understanding. 

That doesn't mean you need to read slowly. Instead, you should read at an adaptive speed. Slow down when you need to, speed up when you can.

[Learn how to pace yourself adaptively][pace].

You invest time in the text in order to grasp what the author is for and against. This conflict may be summed up in a single thesis sentence, or it may be more subtle. 

The conflict will be nuanced. It's not enough to see that author is against something; you must also understand **why** they're opposed.

## Crush The Questions

After investing time to understand the text, you can gain time by crushing the questions.

You crush the questions by

1. using your understanding and 
2. moving confidently through the answers.

### Use Your Understanding

How you use your understanding changes depending on the question's size. 

In the Reading section, questions range from **big**, which ask about the main conflict, to **small**, which ask about specific points.

Size | Method
-- | --
[Big][big]: <br>asks about the main conflict. | **Eliminate** answers that are inconsistent with the main point.
[Small][small]: <br> asks about specific points. | Know where to go back in the text to **prove** the correct answer.
[Medium][medium]: <br> goes beyond the text. | Do both: predict to eliminate *and* go back to prove.

### Move Confidently Through The Answers

In order to move quickly, you must trust your understanding. You cannot trust the answers because the answers are designed to [confuse][confuse] you.

To avoid getting turned around by the answers, be decisive. For each answer, decide to either eliminate, defer, or select it.

[Eliminate] **poisoned** answers | Find the one poisonous word that makes it wrong.
[Defer] on **weirdo** answers | Don't spend time on confusing answers or answers you aren't sure about until you need to.
[Select] the **best** answer | You might love the best answer, or it might just be the least bad option.

## Timing

You will finish with time to spare if you spend:

- 3:00 on the text (+/- 0:30); and
- 0:45 per question (+/- 0:15).
- (3:00 x 4 texts) + (0:45 x 27 questions) = 32:15
