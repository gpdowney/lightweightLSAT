*Caveat: I am not an admissions expert. The following is based only on my very partial and biased experience.*

## The LSAT is for law school

The LSAT isn't the only test you can take. Many law schools now accept the GRE.

If you want to be a lawyer, law school is essential.

Law school can be financially and emotionally expensive. It's not for everyone.

There are several good reasons to go to law school, but you should have a good reason.

## Law school rankings matter

Rankings matter more for law school than for other types of graduate programs.

Generally, students at higher ranked schools will have more and better job opportunities.

There's plenty of good reasons to choose a school besides ranking. Including:

- money,
- location,
- the school's culture,
- the type of law you want to practice.

But these (even money) should probably be secondary considerations that help you decide between closely ranked schools.

The Top 14 schools are the elite.

- The average admit at Yale (#1) scored a 174.
- The average admit at UCLA (#14) scored a 169.

The Top 40 schools are reliably good.

- The average admit at U. Minnesota (#22) scored a 165.
- The average admit at William and Mary (#35) scored a 163.
- Schools ranked lower can be great, but investigate them. Too many law schools will be happy to take your money even if they can't help you get the job you want.
- Do not go to an unaccredited law school. They are almost certainly scams.

The [official rankings come from U.S. News and World Report][1].

More data on individual schools, including admits' median LSAT score, is [available from the American Bar Association][2].

## LSAT + GPA are the most important admissions factors, but they aren't the only factors

An average (for the school) or higher LSAT + GPA will make it more likely that your application will be considered. It does not guarantee admission.

If you have a lower than average (for the school) LSAT + GPA, then you need to give the school another reason to consider your application.

## Your story matters, too

Use your resume and personal statement to tell a compelling story about where you've been and where you're going.

Answer these questions:

- Why law school?
- Why do you want to go to this law school in particular?
- What will you bring to the classroom?
- What will use your law degree to do?

## Don't underestimate your recommenders.

Ask your recommenders if they can honestly write an enthusiastic letter of support. It's fine if they can't, but you need to know.

Recommenders with connections are excellent. Ask if they'd be willing to make a call on your behalf.
