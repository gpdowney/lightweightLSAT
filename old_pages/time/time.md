Managing your time is one of the biggest challenges of the LSAT.

You only have 35 minutes to complete each of the sections. 

- In the Games section, that gives you about 8:30 for each of the 4 games.
- In the Reading section, that also gives you about 8:30 for each of the 4 texts.
- In the Reasoning section, that gives you about 1:20 for each of the ~25 questions.

Benchmarks can be useful. But they're also somewhat misleading, because difficulty can vary dramatically from question to question.

If you thought something on the LSAT was hard, then it was hard. 

If you thought it was easy, then it was easy.

This variable difficulty means that sometimes you'll need to go much slower and sometimes you'll need to go much faster. So the key to mastering timing is **knowing when to speed up and when to slow down.**

Often, when we think of timing, we only think of practicing the first aspect, learning how to speed up. But the second aspect, learning how to slow down, can be even more important.

Primary Skills | Secondary Skills | Practice Ideas
-- | --
[Speed Up][2] | Memorization; <br>Timer as Teacher; <br>Confidence. | Skip Hard Questions; <br>Crush Easy Questions; <br>[Laps]; <br>[Sprints].
[Slow Down][3] | Invest in Understanding; Trust Your Confusion; Adapt to Silly Mistakes. | [Resets].

Mastering both skills allows you to remain in the driver's seat as you take the LSAT. This is important because if you don't drive, the LSAT will, and the LSAT is a terrible driver.
