1. the [general patterns of all Describe family questions](#general-patterns-of-describe-family-questions), and then 
2. how to recognize and approach the three common types, including
    - [Conclusion](#conclusion),
    - [Role](#role), and
    - [Parallel](#parallel) questions.

## General Patterns of Describe Family Questions

On Describe family questions your job is to understand the *structure* of the argument. 

When Describe questions feel easy, let them be easy.

When Describe questions feel hard, look for objective indicators of structure like **conditional logic** or **fact, conclusion, and pivot words**.

In the Argue family, conclusion words reliably point to the conclusion.

But in the Describe family, particularly when your only job is to find the conclusion, the LSAT maybe use a conclusion word for a **sub-conclusion**. Sub-conclusions look like a conclusion, walk like a conclusion, even quack like a conclusion, but they actually support another, final conclusion.

Describe questions may also attempt to confuse you with **pronouns, double negatives, or commas**.

Describe questions are Mechanical in style because you can make specific predictions. But since your job is only to understand the argument, within the Describe family, there isn't much of a difference between an anchor prediction and a specific prediction.

Expect the correct answer to include the exact same ideas or structure, but not necessarily the same words or content.

## 3 Flavors of Parallel Questions

Parallel questions come in 3 flavors. The question looks similar for each, so you can only tell them apart by their arguments.

Flavor | How You Can Tell | How to Approach Them
Conditional | The argument features conditional words <br>(if, only, all, etc...) | Diagram the argument
Flawed | The argument is bad | Choose the answer that commits the same error
Non-Condition + <br>Non-Flawed | The argument seems solid, but doesn't use conditional logic | Match structural words <br>(like: and, or, but, so, because)
