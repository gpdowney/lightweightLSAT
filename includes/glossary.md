*[LSAC]: The organization that designs and administers the LSAT.
*[curve]: The LSAT is a curved test. Scores, in the 120-180 range, are based on your percentile rank. For example, a 150 means you scored in the 50th percentile (aka better than 50% of people and worse than 50% of people). The LSAC works hard to ensure that the curve is consistent so that a 150 means the same thing, no matter the test.
*[strength]: The tone or degree of a word. The LSAT often tests your capacity to match strength.
*[modest]: Modest words hem and haw. They leave lots of possibilities open.
*[strong]: Strong words are absolute, judgmental, normative. They narrow the possibilities.
*[poison]: A word or phrase that makes an answer wrong.
*[weirdo]: An answer you aren't sure about. Might seem more or less OK. Generally defer on these.
*[cowboy]: A student who doesn't have a system for approaching the LSAT.
*[wizard]: A student who solves games by staring and thinking hard.
*[knight]: A student who thinks comprehensive knowledge of the test can protect them from the whims of the LSAT.
*[robot]: A student who works methodically to create hypos to solve games.
*[Games]: The Games section. Others call it "Logic Games" or "LG". The LSAT calls it "Analytic Reasoning"
*[situation]: The paragraph that describes a game.
*[rule]: A restriction on the game.
*[element]: One of the game's moving parts.
*[index]: A list you make of all the elements.
*[board]: How you draw the situation. For example, a number line for standard order games. 
*[hypo]: A hypothetical. A complete hypo puts all the elements on a board and doesn't break any of the rules.
*[numeric]: Information about numbers in a game. For example, how often each element can/must be used or the size of groups.
*[family]: A broad category with a shared approach. The Game families are ORDER and GROUP. The Reasoning families are DESCRIBE, ARGUE, and INFER.
*[type]: A specific category within a family that has a special approach. For example, FLOW games are a specific type within the ORDER family.
*[ORDER]: Games in which the elements go one at a time.
*[GROUP]: Games in which the elements go together in a few buckets.
*[scan]: A quick glance at the game before you start drawing. Allows you assess the game's type and spot weird stuff.
*[check]: A last chance to make sure your drawing is complete and accurate before moving into the questions.
*[splits]: When the game (or a specific hypo) can only go 2-3 ways, and you draw out all of those possibilities.
*[connections]: When rules can be combined to generate new information about the game.
*[leftovers]: Elements not governed by any rules.
*[overlapping rule]: A rule that contains the element you've just added to your board. Useful to check while making hypos.
*[taking care of]: When you make sure that a rule cannot be broken.
*[Reading]: The Reading Comprehension section (aka RC).
*[SMALL]: A Reading question about a detail. The correct answer will be directly proven by the text.
*[BIG]: A Reading question about the whole text.
*[MEDIUM]: A Reading question that goes beyond the text, but is always supported by the text.
*[Reasoning]: The Logical Reasoning section (aka LR).
*[facts]: The basis for an argument. You must accept these as true.
*[conclusion]: The point of an argument. You may wonder whether the facts actually support it.
*[style]: Reasoning questions can be either MECHANICAL or ORGANIC in style. A question's style tells you what kind of attention you need to pay to the argument and what kind of prediction you should make.
*[MECHANICAL]: Reasoning questions that reward pedantic attention and benefit from making specific predictions. Often feature conditional logic.
*[ORGANIC]: Reasoning questions that reward holistic attention and benefit from making flexible predictions.
*[anchor]: A clear understanding of the argument that keeps you grounded through the answer choices.
*[specific prediction]: An exact idea you need the answer to give you.
*[flexible prediction]: A sense of the argument's problem so you can be open to different solutions (or attacks).
*[anti-thesis]: The view the argument is against. Often signaled by pivot words.
*[sub-conclusion]: Walks like a conclusion, talks like a conclusion, quacks like a conclusion, but it's actually a fact.
*[flaw]: a error in reasoning so common that it has a name.
*[gap]: a missing link between the facts and the conclusion.
*[what if]: an alternative possibility that makes the argument more or less likely.
*[relevant]: an answer that address the problem in an argument.
*[irrelevant]: an answer that doesn't address the problem in an argument.
