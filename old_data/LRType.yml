- type: conclusion
  family: describe 
  style: mechanical
  clues: |
    ...describes the main point
    
    ...is the conclusion
  basics: Find the conclusion sentence.
  job: Find the conclusion sentence. Find the same essential ideas in the correct answer.
  tips: Presume that the conclusion is *not* the last sentence, and do *not* trust conclusion words.

- type: role
  family: describe 
  style: mechanical
  clues: "*blah blah blah* plays which one of the following roles/functions..."
  basics: Define the relationship between the conclusion and the target sentence.
  job: Define the relationship between the "blah blah blah" and the conclusion.
  tips: |
    At first, ignore the "blah blah blah." 
    
    Eliminate answers that are mistaken about either (a) the conclusion or (b) their relationship.

- type: parallel
  family: describe 
  style: mechanical
  clues: |
    parallels the reasoning
    
    uses the same reasoning as above
  basics: Map the argument's abstract structure.
  job: Abstract the structure (ignore the content).
  tips: |
    The order of words does not matter.

    Smell Test = if you're looking for a bad argument, get rid of good answers. If you're looking for a solid argument, get rid of flawed answers.

    [Count Count](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMrr6s8CSDo) = the correct answer must have the same number and type of facts and the same type of conclusion. Imagine yourself saying "1 conditional, 2 conditional, a conditional conclusionâ€¦ Hahaha"

- type: hurt
  family: argue 
  style: organic
  clues: |
    Which of the following, if true, most weakens the argument?
    
    ...expresses a flaw in the reasoning
    
    The argument is most vulnerable to the criticism that it...
  basics: Hurt the argument.
  job: Point out or exploit the argument's problem. Make the argument worse.
  tips: |
    The correct answer doesn't need to be completely devastating. It only needs to have some negative effect.
    
    There is only one correct answer. All of the other answers are either irrelevant or helpful.
    
    Eliminate "it didn't do that" answers. If you find a common flaw, eliminate answers that address a different flaw.

- type: help
  family: argue 
  style: organic
  clues: |
    "Which of the following, if true, most strengthens the argument?"
    
    "Which one of the following would, if true, help most to explain the result described above?"
  basics: Help the argument.
  job: Address the argument's problem. Make the conclusion slightly more likely.
  tips: Help-explain questions are a special sub-type. They don't give full arguments. They give two seemingly opposed facts. You help by explaining why the facts actually go together.

- type: justify
  family: argue 
  style: mechanical
  clues: |
    "Which one of the following, if true, allows the conclusion of the argument to be properly drawn?"
  
    ...makes the conclusion logically valid?
  
    Which of the following principles would most help to justify the argument above?
  basics: Close the gap in the argument.
  job: Find the gap. Completely connect the facts to the conclusion so there's no doubt.
  tips: |
    Know exactly what ideas need to be linked before you look at the answers.
    
    A new idea in the conclusion must be defined in the correct answer.

- type: depends
  family: argue 
  style: both
  clues: |
    "Which one of the following is an assumption on which the argument depends?"
  
    ...does the argument require?
  
    ...is an assumption necessary for the argument to be valid?
  basics: Find the answer that the argument depends on.
  job: |
    It depends... do you see a clear gap? 
    
    If yes, approach Mechanically (like a Justify question). 
    
    If no, approach Organically (like a Help question).
  tips: Always negate the answer you like.

- type: most supported
  family: infer 
  style: organic
  clues: |
    Most supported by the information above
  
    Most logically completes the argument
  
    Can be inferred from the statements given
  basics: Find the answer that combines the facts.
  job: Pick the allowable combination of the given facts. Know what you know and don't go beyond that.
  tips: |
    Usually the correct answer will combine information from multiple facts (not merely restate one fact).

    You can refer back the facts to double-check or eliminate answers. (Although this is time intensive.)

- type: disagree
  family: infer 
  style: organic
  clues: |
    most likely to agree about
  
    would be most likely to disagree on
  basics: Find the overlap between the two speakers.
  job: Find the overlap between the two speakers.
  tips:  |
    The second speaker may say what they (dis)agree with.
    
    The correct answer doesn't have to be the main point, just something they both address.
    
    Notice whether you need to find a point of *agreement* or *disagreement*.

    Just because there's two speakers doesn't mean it's this question type.

- type: must be true
  family: infer 
  style: mechanical
  clues: |
    "Which of the following must be true based on the above?"

    Or, it looks like a Most Supported question, but it features either
    - conditional logic, or
    - chained causation, or
    - repeated phrases.
  basics: Draw a diagram to combine the facts.
  job: Draw a diagram to combine the facts.
  tips:  |
    Use contrapositives to make connections.
    
    If there's conditionals, ignore everything that isn't conditional.

- type: must be false
  family: infer 
  style: mechanical
  clues: "Which of the following must be false based on the above?"
  basics: Find an absolute fact that can be contradicted.
  job: Find the absolute statement, then contradict it.
  tips: Ignore the interesting bits. Focus only on the absolutes.

- type: rule
  family: infer 
  style: mechanical
  clues: |
    "Which of the following examples conforms to the principles stated above?"
    
    "Which of the following violates the principle stated above?"
  basics: Diagram the rule(s). Find an answer that follows them.
  job: |
    1. Diagram the rules. 
    2. Eliminate **unprovable** answers. 
    3. Select the answer that follows the rules.
  tips: |
    Answers are only provable if they're trying to prove the [right side of the arrow](conditionals.html#rulediagram).

    For "violates the principle" questions, pick the answer that *breaks* the rules (and don't just pick an irrelevant answer).

- type: example
  family: family
  style: style
  clues: |
    "What this question might look like in full?"
    
    Or key words that indicate the question is of this type
  job: |
    1. Simple
    2. Instructions
    3. For approaching the question.
